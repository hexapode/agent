    "result": "Internet Censorship 2023: A Global Map of Internet Restrictions \nInterested in learning where your country stands on internet censorship? We’ve broken down every country’s online restrictions into an easy-to-read guide.\n<img />\n\nMore than 60 percent of the world’s population (5.03 billion people) uses the internet. It’s our source of instant information, entertainment, news, and social interactions.\n\nBut where in the world can citizens enjoy equal and open internet access – if anywhere?\n\nIn this exploratory study, our researchers have conducted a country-by-country comparison to see which countries impose the harshest internet restrictions and where citizens can enjoy the most online freedom. This includes restrictions or bans for torrenting, pornography, social media, and VPNs. Also whether there are restrictions or heavy censorship of political media and any additional restrictions for messaging/VoIP apps.\n\nAlthough the usual culprits take the top spots, a few seemingly free countries rank surprisingly high. With ongoing restrictions and pending laws, our online freedom is at more risk than ever.\n\nWe scored each country on six criteria. Each of these is worth two points aside from messaging/VoIP apps which is worth one (this is due to many countries banning or restricting certain apps but allowing ones run by the government/telecoms providers within the country). The country receives one point if the content—torrents, pornography, news media, social media, VPNs, messaging/VoIP apps—is restricted but accessible, and two points if it is banned entirely. The higher the score, the more censorship.\n\n<a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Wh&#47;WhichCountriesAretheMostCensoredintheWorld&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a>                \n<b><b>The worst countries for internet censorship</b></b>\n<ol><li><b>North Korea and China (11/11) –</b> Once again, these two countries are at the top of the list with the highest score possible. There isn’t anything either of them doesn’t heavily censor thanks to their iron grip over the entire internet. Users are unable to use western social media, watch porn, or use torrents or VPNs*. And all of the political media published in the country is heavily censored and influenced by the government. Both also shut down messaging apps from abroad, forcing residents to use ones that have been made (and are likely controlled) within the country, e.g. WeChat in China. Not only does WeChat have no form of end-to-end encryption, the app also has backdoors that enable third parties to access messages.</li>\n<li><b>Iran, Myanmar, Turkmenistan, and UAE (9/11):</b> In second place this year are Iran, Myanmar, Turkmenistan, and the UAE. Iran claws back two points due to it not completely banning torrenting or VPNs. That said, the government is trying to implement a “legal VPN” scheme in which individuals will have to apply for a VPN connection, meaning a high level of control and monitoring from the government.Turkmenistan and the UAE both gained a point for added censorship this time around. Turkmenistan now bans VPNs and people have even been forced to <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/turkmenistan-vpn-koran-ban/31402718.html\">swear on the Koran</a> that they will not use one, while the UAE has upped its crackdown on illegal torrenting.But it’s Myanmar that has seen one of the worst declines with its score increasing by three points. This is due to the military blocking social media platforms for an open-ended period of time and a ban on VPNs.</li>\n<li><b>Belarus, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, and Uzbekistan (8/11):</b> Belarus, Qatar, Syria, and Thailand all featured in our “worst countries” breakdown in 2021. But this year they are joined by Oman, Pakistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. All of the countries ban pornography, have heavily censored political media, restrict social media, and restrict the use of VPNs. And all but Thailand and Belarus have messaging/VoIP app restrictions, but Thailand is the only country to actively ban torrenting.</li></ol>\n*Even though VPNs are technically blocked, some do still work in <a href=\"https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/whats-the-best-vpn-for-china-5-that-still-work-in-2016/\">China</a>. This is the same with porn websites in many of the aforementioned countries. Many porn websites will create “mirror” sites to give access to people in restricted countries, but these will often be blocked once authorities become aware of them.\n\n\n<b><b>The countries that have increased censorship in 2023</b></b>\nIf we compare the scores for each country from our 2021 study to our 2023 study, there are 27 countries that appear to have upped their censorship. Five countries have introduced more than one new censorship rule. One, as we have already seen, is Myanmar with three new changes. Likewise, Sri Lanka also added three new means of censoring– these were the banning of torrents, restricting certain VPNs, and long blockages of social media due to protests in the country.\n\nElsewhere, Afghanistan has seen increased censorship across political and social media. With the Taliban regaining control over the country, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/afghanistan/freedom-world/2022\">231 media outlets have since been shut down</a> and mobile phones have been searched for social media posts criticizing their regime.\n\nThe Indian government has also ordered companies to <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/india-orders-vpn-companies-to-collect-and-hand-over-user-data/\">collect and hand over VPN user data</a>. The government also uses a monitoring system (CMS) which is able to intercept any online activities including VoIP messages.\n\n<b><b>Online censorship in Europe</b></b>\n\n<ul><li>18 countries have banned or shut down torrenting sites. A further 25 European countries also have measures in place but aren’t blocking websites as of yet (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia) to name a few. As they aren’t blocking torrenting sites, these haven’t been scored as having “sites blocked” and are instead scored as being “restricted.”</li>\n<li>While torrenting websites are often blocked in Spain (hence why it is classed as having shut down torrenting sites), rules do permit torrenting for personal use (downloading to view but not to upload or distribute).</li>\n<li>Ukraine restricts online pornography while Belarus and Turkey ban/block the content entirely.</li>\n<li>Political media is restricted in 12 countries. Kosovo and Montenegro relaxed censorship of political media this year.</li>\n<li>Two countries heavily censor political media – Belarus and Turkey.</li>\n<li>No European countries block or ban social media but four do restrict it. These are Belarus, Spain, Turkey, and Ukraine. Montenegro improved on social media censorship due to the current government allowing a more free expression of personal views.</li>\n<li>Turkey restricts the use of VPNs while Belarus bans them entirely.</li>\n<li>Turkey is the only European country to restrict VoIP messaging services, the popular VoIP messaging app <a href=\"https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/vpn-whatsapp-blocked-turkey/#:~:text=WhatsApp%20is%20banned%20in%20Turkey,the%20platform%20using%20a%20VPN\">WhatsApp has been banned in Turkey</a>. Instead, the government has introduced its own alternative (BiP) but this app doesn’t respect user privacy and has its own monitoring issues.</li></ul>\n<b><b>Online censorship in North America</b></b>\n\n<ul><li>Canada, Mexico, and the United States have banned or shut down torrenting sites.</li>\n<li>Cuba is the only country to restrict online pornography, heavily censor its political media, and restrict VPNs.</li>\n<li>Six other countries (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, and Panama) have some restrictions across their political media.</li>\n<li>Cuba and Honduras have restrictions across social media platforms.</li>\n<li>Messaging and VoIP apps are met with restrictions in Belize, Cuba, and Mexico. Cuba restricted access to social media and WhatsApp following anti-government protests. In Mexico, some ISPs block VoIP services. Belize telecoms providers offer their own VoIP services while banning others.</li>\n<li>There have been no new updates in North America this year so far, the only region to do so.</li></ul>\n<b><b>Online censorship in South America</b></b>\n\n<ul><li>Argentina is the only country to actively block torrenting websites while Venezuela is the only one to restrict online pornography.</li>\n<li>Political media restrictions have increased in South America with a total of eight countries now displaying some restrictions across these platforms. Brazil and Paraguay join the list this year due to heavy government interference in Brazil and corrupt authorities in Paraguay that encourage self-censorship. Venezuela also heavily censors political media with persistent attempts to control the news and silence independent media outlets.</li>\n<li>Venezuela still has social media restrictions, while Ecuador has improved its score this year with no connectivity disruptions on social media since 2019 protests.</li>\n<li>Venezuela has increased its restrictions on VPNs with some even being blocked.</li>\n<li>Three countries have restricted messaging/VoIP apps (Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela). As well as VoIP apps being banned by Brazil’s largest ISP, a bill <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/faq-why-brazils-plan-mandate-traceability-private-messaging-apps-will-break-users\">threatened to mandate traceability</a> in private messaging (however, in June 2022, the <a href=\"https://www.cigionline.org/articles/in-brazil-techno-authoritarianism-rears-its-head/\">Brazilian congress rejected the fast-tracking of the bill</a> so, at the time of writing, the bill is still not law ).</li></ul>\n<b><b>Online censorship in Asia</b></b>\n\n<ul><li>15 Asian countries have blocked or banned torrenting sites.</li>\n<li>The majority of Asian countries have restrictions on online pornography (40 out of the 49 we covered–82 percent) with 27 of these having full bans/blocks.</li>\n<li>Political media is also heavily restricted and censored in Asia. 42 (86 percent) of the countries we covered have restrictions. The majority of countries (31) are also subject to heavy censorship with Afghanistan, Hong Kong, and Palestine all increasing their censorship over the last year or so.</li>\n<li>A large number (37) of these countries restrict social media platforms in some way. China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, and Turkmenistan go one step further and enforce full bans across popular social media platforms.</li>\n<li>Five countries have full bans on VPN use (China, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea, and Turkmenistan), and a further 16 impose restrictions.</li>\n<li>Messaging and VoIP app restrictions are also commonplace in Asia with 16 countries implementing some form of limitation. Bangladesh imposed large fines of up to Tk15 lakh (nearly USD$15k) on four telecom operators for illegal VoIP technology. India and Pakistan also introduced restrictions on VoIP apps.</li></ul>\n<b><b>Online censorship in Africa</b></b>\n\n<ul><li>South Africa is the only African country to actively shut down torrenting sites.</li>\n<li>15 African countries have restrictions when it comes to online pornography with five of these having full bans (Botswana, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Tanzania, and Uganda).</li>\n<li>Most of the African countries we covered (44 of 53–83 percent) restrict political media. 13 of these enforce heavy censorship including the Central African Republic and Ethiopia, both of which increased censorship this year. Ghana gained a point for restricted political media due to artificial political narratives being at the forefront of their media.</li>\n<li>64 percent of the African countries we covered implement social media restrictions but only one of these–Eritrea–has gone so far as to continually block access to social media sites.</li>\n<li>Egypt and Uganda are the only two countries to restrict VPN use. Despite VPNs being legal, many VPN providers’ websites and servers are blocked (<a href=\"https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/best-vpns-for-egypt-unblock-skype-whatsapp-facebook-facetime/\">these are the best options when choosing a VPN in Egypt</a>).</li>\n<li>Egypt is also one of the seven African countries to restrict the use of messaging/VoIP apps. The others are Burundi, Equatorial Guinea, Sierra Leone, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia.</li></ul>\n<b><b>Online censorship in Oceania</b></b>\n\n<ul><li>Australia is the only country to strictly enforce torrenting bans/blocks and, along with Papua New Guinea, has restrictions on online pornography, too. The Australian Broadcasting Service Act 1992 illegalizes watching internet porn, establishing it as a fineable offense. However, only some towns and cities have tried to establish a full ban. Australia has also recently introduced its <a href=\"https://www.esafety.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-07/Online%20Safety%20Act%20-%20Fact%20sheet.pdf\">Online Safety Act</a>, which enforces new industry codes for illegal and restricted content. These codes must be registered and can detect age-inappropriate content like pornography.</li>\n<li>Political media is restricted in Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, and Tonga. Papua New Guinea has the ability to restrict social media through its cybercrime law, which was introduced in 2016. Fiji has also warned residents not to express anything on social media that opposes some new local laws.</li>\n<li>None of the Oceania countries restrict the use of VPNs or VoIP/messaging apps.</li></ul>\n<b>See also</b>: <a href=\"https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/best-vpn-for-porn/\">Best VPNs to watch Porn Anonymously</a>\n\n<b><b>Will online censorship become the “norm?”</b></b>\nWhile it’s no great surprise to see the likes of China, North Korea, and Iran topping the list, the growing number of restrictions in many other countries is greatly concerning. This year we have seen 27 countries increasing their internet censorship, compared to just 3 from last year’s study. Most of the new restrictions this year were located in Asia, with most changes coming from political media and VPN restrictions.\n\nFrom Myanmar’s social media blocking attempts and bans on VPNs to Afghanistan shutting down hundreds of media outlets, our online freedom is something we can no longer take for granted.\n\nThankfully, VPNs do still offer a way for many of us to surf the net privately (and legally). But as censorship becomes increasingly common, more and more countries could join the restricted list, putting citizens’ digital privacy at risk.\n\n<b><b>Methodology</b></b>\nTo find out to what extent each country is censored, we have studied each in detail to see what restrictions, if any, they impose across torrents, pornography, political media, social media, VPNs, and messaging/VoIP apps.\n\nWe scored each country on six criteria. Each of these is worth two points aside from messaging/VoIP apps which is worth one (this is due to many countries banning or restricting certain apps but allowing ones run by the government/telecoms providers within the country). The country receives one point if the content—torrents, pornography, news media, social media, VPNs, messaging/VoIP apps—is restricted but accessible and two points if it is banned entirely. The higher the score, the more censorship.\n\nIn some cases, countries may be scored as having banned one of these areas but residents may find ways to circumnavigate these bans, e.g. with VPNs or mirror sites. However, as the country enforces this ban by blocking websites or implementing laws, the country is scored as having banned it. On the other hand, if a country has brought in regulations to try and restrict or ban an area but users continue to be able to freely use these services/websites, the country is only scored as being “restricted” because the regulations/laws aren’t being enforced.\n\n<b>Data researcher:</b>Charlotte Bond\n\n<b><b>Sources</b></b>\n<a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/ranking#\">Rsf.org</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/\">https://freedomhouse.org/</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ct1fMxC4URDj1eYBQMOWDedb9L0R1iQK4t8CNiJGrBg/edit?usp=sharing\">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ct1fMxC4URDj1eYBQMOWDedb9L0R1iQK4t8CNiJGrBg/edit?usp=sharing</a>\n\n<b>Internet censorship FAQs</b>\n<b>What is the Communications Decency Act (CDA)?</b>The Communications Decency Act (CDA) was the United States Congress's first attempt to regulate pornographic material on the Internet. The CDA was introduced as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The CDA made it a crime to use any telecommunications device to send or receive obscene or indecent material. The CDA also created a safe harbor for Internet service providers, shielding them from liability for user-generated content.<b>How big of a problem is censorship in schools?</b>Censorship in schools is a growing problem that has recently gained more attention. With the rise of technology, it has become easier for school administrators to monitor and control the content students are exposed to. This can lead to issues such as limiting access to important information and resources or preventing students from expressing their opinions."

The surveys ask a set of questions designed to measure each country's level of Internet and digital media freedom, as well as the access and openness of other digital means of transmitting information, particularly mobile phones and text messaging services.\nResults are presented for three areas:\n\n<ul><li>Obstacles to Access: infrastructural and economic barriers to access; governmental efforts to block specific applications or technologies; legal and ownership control over internet and mobile phone access providers.</li>\n<li>Limits on Content: filtering and blocking of websites; other forms of censorship and self-censorship; manipulation of content; the diversity of online news media; and usage of digital media for social and political activism.</li>\n<li>Violations of User Rights: legal protections and restrictions on online activity; surveillance and limits on privacy; and repercussions for online activity, such as legal prosecution, imprisonment, physical attacks, or other forms of harassment.</li></ul>\nThe results from the three areas are combined into a total score for a country (from 0 for best to 100 for worst) and countries are rated as \"Free\" (0 to 30), \"Partly Free\" (31 to 60), or \"Not Free\" (61 to 100) based on the totals.\nStarting in 2009 Freedom House has produced thirteen editions of the report.<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2009-1\">[1]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2011-2\">[2]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2012-3\">[3]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2013-4\">[4]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2014-5\">[5]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2015-6\">[6]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2016-7\">[7]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2017-8\">[8]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-FOTN-2018-9\">[9]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:1-10\">[10]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:2-11\">[11]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:3-12\">[12]</a><a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-:0-13\">[13]</a>\nThere was no report in 2010.

href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/OpenNet_Initiative\">OpenNet Initiative</a> (ONI) classified the magnitude of censorship or filtering occurring in a country in four areas of activity.<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-ONICountryProfiles-14\">[14]</a>\nThe magnitude or level of censorship was classified as follows:\n\n<b>Pervasive</b>: A large portion of content in several categories is blocked.\n<b>Substantial</b>: A number of categories are subject to a medium level of filtering or many categories are subject to a low level of filtering.\n<b>Selective</b>: A small number of specific sites are blocked or filtering targets a small number of categories or issues.\n<b>Suspected</b>: It is suspected, but not confirmed, that Web sites are being blocked.\n<b>No evidence</b>: No evidence of blocked Web sites, although other forms of controls may exist.\nThe classifications were done for the following areas of activity:\n\n<b>Political</b>: Views and information in opposition to those of the current government or related to human rights, freedom of expression, minority rights, and religious movements.\n<b>Social</b>: Views and information perceived as offensive or as socially sensitive, often related to sexuality, gambling, or illegal drugs and alcohol.\n<b>Conflict/security</b>: Views and information related to armed conflicts, border disputes, separatist movements, and militant groups.\n<b>Internet tools</b>: e-mail, Internet hosting, search, translation, and Voice-over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services, and censorship or filtering circumvention methods.\nDue to legal concerns the ONI does not check for filtering of <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Child_pornography\">child pornography</a> and because their classifications focus on technical filtering, they do not include other types of censorship.\nThrough 2010 the OpenNet Initiative had documented Internet filtering by governments in over forty countries worldwide.<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Noman-2011-15\">[15]</a> The level of filtering was classified in 26 countries in 2007 and in 25 countries in 2009. Of the 41 separate countries classified in these two years, seven were found to show no evidence of filtering (<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Egypt\">Egypt</a>, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_France\">France</a>, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Germany\">Germany</a>, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_India\">India</a>, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_Kingdom\">the United Kingdom</a>, and <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_United_States\">the United States</a>), while one was found to engage in pervasive filtering in all areas (<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China\">China</a>), 13 were found to engage in pervasive filtering in one or more areas, and 34 were found to engage in some level of filtering in one or more areas. Of the 10 countries classified in both 2007 and 2009, one reduced its level of filtering (<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Pakistan\">Pakistan</a>), five increased their level of filtering (<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Azerbaijan\">Azerbaijan</a>, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Belarus\">Belarus</a>, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Kazakhstan\">Kazakhstan</a>, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_South_Korea\">South Korea</a>, and <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Uzbekistan\">Uzbekistan</a>), and four maintained the same level of filtering (China, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Iran\">Iran</a>, <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Myanmar\">Myanmar</a>, and <a href=\"en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Human_rights_in_Tajikistan\">Tajikistan</a>).<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-UNESCO-2011-16\">[16]</a>\nIn December 2014 ONI announced that:<a href=\"en.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-17\">[17]</a>\n\nAfter a decade of collaboration in the study and documentation of Internet filtering and control mechanisms around the world, the OpenNet Initiative partners will no longer carry out research under the ONI banner. The ONI website, including all reports and data, will be maintained indefinitely to allow continued public access to their entire archive of published work and data.\nONI's summarized global Internet filtering data was last updated on 20 September 2013.\n\n<b>Reporters Without Borders[<a

    "result": "The internet might split up into the internets, because no one can figure out how to regulate it\nThe infrastructure of the internet exists in real places and governments are awakening to the idea that they can use that fact to regulate what we do online.\nWe’re used to thinking of the internet as a place that exists apart from our physical presence in a particular country. I can send an email to someone who lives in New Zealand as easily as I can to someone next door. When I do, thousands of independent computer networks whisk my message around the globe without regard for the walls, mountains, oceans, or border fences that stand in the way. There are no import tariffs, national taxes, or customs agents to deal with. There are, it seems, no national borders on the internet.\nSlowly, that fiction is coming apart. The infrastructure of the internet exists in real places and governments are awakening to the idea that they can use that fact to regulate what we do online. Increasingly, each country wants to control the internet in the same way they do financial transactions, immigration, or the postal system. If your data crosses enters their territory they want to be able to inspect it, count it, and—not yet, but maybe someday—tax it.\nAdvertisementThe internet doesn’t have borders that clearly delineate where one country’s legal jurisdiction stops and the next country’s begins. Yet rules crafted by one country have implications for users everywhere. For example, EU courts have used their homegrown ”right to be forgotten” to insist that search engines remove links for all users <a href=\"https://qz.com/507040/france-is-now-censoring-your-google-search-results-wherever-you-are\">in the EU</a>, regardless of whether or not they are EU citizens. Google, despite being an American company, has removed <a href=\"https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/europeprivacy/\">nearly 600,000 such links</a>. French regulators have gone even further, insisting that Google also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/19/google-right-to-be-forgotten-fight-france-highest-court\">remove those links around the world</a>. A similar case is now before the <a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/19/canadian-judge-says-google-must-remove-links-worldwide/\">supreme court of Canada</a>. None of these decisions would be legal in the US.\nIn the absence of any uniform global regulation, this tangle of local decision-making raises complex issues. Do countries abide by one another’s laws? Do they refuse? Do they censor foreign websites that fail to comply? If France is allowed to unilaterally export its laws via the internet, then why not <a href=\"https://qz.com/733847/turkey-blocked-three-social-media-giants-and-its-internet-traffic-fell-by-half\">Turkey</a>? Or <a href=\"https://qz.com/402902/there-are-now-160-million-internet-users-in-the-arab-world-but-the-wrong-tweet-could-still-land-you-in-jail-in-many-countries\">Saudi Arabia</a>?\nFor internet-natives, it is tempting to frame any threat to the independence of the internet as one of doddering old governments trampling on the youthful spirit of innovation. However, the dangers of not enforcing domestic laws are also real. As criminal threats move online, so must the tools governments use to combat them. How can a government protect the privacy of an email account held by a private company halfway around the world?\nOver the last few years, privacy and national security have developed into wedge issues, which are driving countries apart. As national priorities harden into law, the internet risks being fragmented into 100 little pieces—what some have called a “<a href=\"https://qz.com/226949/the-internet-is-fracturing-into-separate-country-specific-networks\">splinternet</a>.” So far this process has been slow, but that makes it all the more risky, because for the most part it is also completely invisible.\nAdvertisement<b><b>The internet’s layered model</b></b>Though few people are aware of them, there are international organizations that govern the internet. Groups such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) set standards and handle distribution of limited resources, such as domain names. Vint Cerf, widely credited as the man responsible for devising the protocols that make up the internet, has written about the difficulties of governing the internet’s many parts. In <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2309772\">a 2013 paper</a> written with Patrick Ryan and Max Senges, he mapped out the layers of the internet.\n<img />Vint Cerf’s layered model of the internet.Each layer in Cerf’s model corresponds to a bundle of internet features that are built on those below and necessary to those above. For example, the Domain Name System (DNS), which maps names such as “qz.com” to internet addresses, sits at the Logical Layer because it is built on networking technology from the Infrastructure Layer, and facilitates the publication of websites at the Content Layer. In theory each of these layers can be governed in isolation of the others. His bullet points describe some of the issues relevant to each layer.\nMost of today’s internet battles, such as those over censorship and identity theft, center on Cerf’s Content and Social layers, which are where users actually interact with one another. These are, not by coincidence, the parts of the internet that the traditional governance organizations, such as ICANN, tend to avoid. Those organizations have long advocated a hands-off policy when it comes to what is and isn’t allowed on the internet. In the absence of official oversight, the United States has sometimes acted as a de facto global regulator, if only because most so-called “internet giants” are based in the US, and thus subject to US law.\nAdvertisementToday that central power is diminishing. Some of this is by design—everyone agrees centralized authority is a bad design for an international institution. Other changes are driven by the rise of new internet superpowers, such as China, who rightfully want a seat at the table.\nAs power has diffused, disputes have arisen over how best to control, store, and transmit data while safeguarding (or, in the case of repressive regimes, handcuffing), the rights of a country’s citizens. These issues lie squarely in those unregulated, upper layers of Cerf’s model where users live. Into that power vacuum stepped Edward Snowden. His 2013 revelation that the NSA was scooping up massive amounts of internet traffic single-handedly raised the profile of data flowing across international borders. In his wake many countries are moving aggressively to protect their users from the prying eyes of the US government.\n<b><b>How to barricade the internet</b></b>The techniques for accomplishing this are not new to the internet. China has partially isolated its internet users for more than a decade. However, the privacy issue is also leading to strict controls in places that traditionally were more comfortable with allowing the United States and international governance organizations to chart their own course. Those countries are now reaching out to fill the rule-making gap at the top of Cerf’s internet layer cake with their own, national ideals.\nIn Europe, this has led to a raft of data-protection laws aimed at protecting citizens’ privacy. The most important of these is the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was adopted earlier this year and will come into effect in 2018.\nAdvertisement<img />A carnival float with a papier-mache caricature representing Google and Facebook in the traditional Rose Monday carnival parade in Düsseldorf in 2015.Image: Reuters/Ina FassbenderAt the core of the GDPR is the idea that the EU should be able to regulate the internet for its citizens, no matter where the services they use are actually hosted. For example, under the new rules, a website that sells software EU citizens<b></b>will be subject to EU privacy laws, even if that company is headquartered in Korea and has its data centers in the US. For the first time, companies that fail to comply could <a href=\"http://www.recode.net/2015/10/14/11619536/new-eu-law-will-tell-u-s-what-can-be-said-and-built-on-the-internet\">be slapped with huge fines</a>. Many are bracing themselves for a new era where once-toothless data protection regulators enforce their powers more readily.\n“It’s certainly given [privacy regulators] more prominence, and in some ways it’s long overdue,” said Lillian Pang, a senior legal officer at web hosting firm Rackspace.\nThere is a legal precedent for the GDPR. In 2014, the European Court of Justice ruled that Google’s US search service would be subject to European privacy law, specifically Spanish law, <a href=\"https://iapp.org/news/a/the-right-to-be-forgotten-everywhere/\">when it came to privacy complaints</a>. This included the “right to be forgotten,” which allows EU citizens to request specific search results be scrubbed from Google’s index. The courts concluded that because Google offered a localized version of its search services <a href=\"https://www.slaughterandmay.com/media/2535540/new-rules-wider-reach-the-extraterritorial-scope-of-the-gdpr.pdf\">targeting Spanish residents</a> (pdf), the data processed by Google’s US search service fell under the purview of Spanish privacy law.\nAdvertisementAt the core of the GDPR is the idea that the EU should be able to regulate the internet for its citizens, no matter where the services they use are actually hosted.In addition to expanding European influence outside EU borders, the GDPR also includes provisions that encourage data to be kept at home. In particular, companies are not allowed to transfer data outside the EU if the destination country does not have <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm\">adequate privacy safeguards</a>. Any company that handles a large volume of personal data will be required to appoint a Data Protection Officer, who reports to the EU on its compliance efforts. Regulators can also audit companies they believe are skirting the law. French lawmakers further proposed, but <a href=\"https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/2016/07/01/french-parliament-rejects-data-localization-amendment/\">eventually rejected</a>, a rule that would have required French citizens’ data to always be stored in the EU, without exception.\nForcing local storage is another way governments ensure that their citizens’ data remain under the umbrella of their laws. In particular, it guarantees they will have access in the event of a criminal investigation, intellectual-property dispute, or other legal conflict. To the extent that such laws also ban companies from keeping duplicate copies in other countries, they may also be an effective way to prevent foreign surveillance.\nRussia recently <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2016/07/09/nationalized-data-new-russian-legislation-is-latest-example-of-emerging-data-borders/\">passed its own data localization law</a>. Brazil and India are considering similar measures. Many other countries require it <a href=\"http://law.emory.edu/elj/content/volume-64/issue-3/articles/data-nationalism.html\">for certain kinds of data</a>. Bit by bit, Cerf’s top layers are being sliced up.\nAdvertisement<b>The problem with making deals</b>One skilled explorer of the conflicts between national laws on the internet is the Austrian privacy activist and legal provocateur Max Schrems. It was Schrems who, as a law student, brought down the Safe Harbour agreement, a<b></b>trans-Atlantic privacy deal that had allowed EU data to be legally processed in the US since 2000. Safe Harbour was a relatively lax self-certification system that allowed US tech giants to establish European operations with little fuss.\nIn 2013, Schrems pulled the thread that eventually unwound Safe Harbour. He put in a routine request to the Irish data-protection authority for the information Facebook had collected on him. Snowden’s revelations had just hit, and when Schrems received reams of data back from Facebook, which had been stored on US servers, he filed suit against the Irish authority. How could his data be safe, he argued, when the NSA had probably sifted through it while it was stored on American servers?\nEventually, Europe’s highest court agreed with him, and in December 2015, Safe Harbour was struck down. It was invalid because it didn’t protect EU citizens’ data from US government surveillance, the court ruled.\nMuch wrangling commenced to find a replacement, which has now been formalized, called Privacy Shield. The new agreement gives Europeans <a href=\"https://qz.com/608158/against-all-odds-a-new-eu-us-data-privacy-deal-has-been-announced\">extra safeguards</a> against US government surveillance, like the newly created office of an ombudsman in the US State Department.<b></b>But the process of writing it was a rushed and nervous one, with officials often working late into the night, and with the sense that policy-makers were desperately papering over a crack that was growing too large to deal with. Today, the Privacy Shield is a done deal, but Schrems and other observers believe it will be a matter of time before it, too, is deemed inadequate by the EU’s highest court.\nAdvertisementWhen Schrems received reams of data back from Facebook, which had been stored on US servers, he filed suit against the Irish data-protection authority.If personal data is the new oil, as the cliche goes, then surely agreements like Privacy Shield are the obvious way to negotiate the workings of the internet. However, such treaties are slow to produce, inflexible, and difficult to generalize. Imagine going one by one and negotiating a separate deal with every country that has internet users. Ideally, countries would get together and make at least some decisions as a group, but a multi-country agreement seems almost impossible given the awkward and disagreeable process that produced Privacy Shield. If the US and the EU have a hard time agreeing, it’s difficult to imagine a successful agreement that includes Brazil, China, and India—countries with huge numbers of internet users, but wildly different political and legal systems. According to Christopher Kuner, a European privacy lawyer, “There isn’t […] any real political will to have a wide-ranging international agreement on any of this.”\nCerf has argued that treaties are precisely the worst way to approach internet governance. ”As the globe looks toward governance systems for the Internet in the next phase, we should avoid the temptation to enshrine arcane rules in international treaties,” <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2309772\">he wrote</a> (pdf).\nHe appeals to his own utopian ideals, calling for countries to empower (and pay for) the patchwork of NGOs that have overseen the internet’s growth to date. That means organizations like ICANN, the IETF, and the IGF, which Cerf himself is a key member of. He puts his faith in the sort of rough and ready negotiations that gave birth to the internet. ”In some ways, it is the tussle that matters the most—and the willingness of the stakeholders to engage with each other and attempt to work out the policy equivalent of “rough consensus and running code,” he wrote, citing a popular canard about how <a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/tao.html\">internet technology decisions are made</a>.\nAdvertisement<b>The slippery slope</b>Cerf’s vision for empowered, independent<b></b>decision-making isn’t likely to materialize anytime soon. In the absence of international coordination, internet companies may find themselves in the unenviable position of having to satisfy contradictory legal requirements. According to Vivek Krishnamurthy, an instructor at Harvard’s Cyberlaw Clinic, “Companies that happen to be headquartered in the US are going to face more and more conflicting legal demands, including demands that may require them to violate US law in order to comply with the law of another country.”\nAs an example, Krishnamurthy describes a hypothetical case where a foreign state is seeking email held by an American company. The foreign country might supply enough evidence to satisfy its own laws, but not enough to get a warrant in the US. Even storing data separately in each country might not be enough to allow a company to legally, much less ethically, satisfy both laws.\n“There isn’t […] any real political will to have a wide-ranging international agreement on any of this.” — Christopher Kuner, European privacy lawyerMore fundamentally, there is a question about the legal nature of data flowing over the internet. Scholars disagree about whether data has exceptional properties, such as unprecedented mobility and divisibility, and thus should be exempt from existing legal principles that depend on “territoriality,” or pinning down data’s location. “Data is everywhere and anywhere and calls into question which ‘here’ and ‘there’ matter,” according <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2578229\">to Jennifer Daskal</a> (pdf), an associate professor at American University. On the other hand, maybe data is not special at all. Money and debt are intangible assets that have similar properties, and they have been successfully governed for centuries, as Andrew K. Woods, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky <a href=\"http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=695120099066115010027099115077077092097036019031031092110087123090071087089112073093056035048125008059096097000070026070125119038022089021065121029089113117099064024046007086081070084082071080120118000114089008091074067018003111093023002015114102029&EXT=pdf\">has written</a> (pdf).\nAdvertisementIn a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/07/the-end-of-the-internet/372301/\">worst-case scenario</a>, it’s easy to imagine all these disagreements pushing the world to a point where each country has “an internet” that stops at its borders. That shouldn’t sound too far-fetched: China already has exactly that and Russia seems to be actively pursuing the same thing. Services which fail to comply with local laws get blocked, either through onerous fines or outright bans. Domestic alternatives fill in the gaps, such as Sina Weibo and WeChat in China, or Yandex and VK in Russia.<b></b>In a future in which a lot more countries apply these sorts of controls, communication across borders will effectively require a layer of national censorship. How else can you prevent foreign services from skirting the rules?\nThat isn’t to say every state will use those regulations to suppress its citizens, but rather that the internet itself risks becoming balkanized to the point where communication between people in different states<b></b>is a much more bureaucratic affair. If the US and Europe arrive at fundamentally incompatible rules for privacy online, does that mean they will need to negotiate a treaty in order for me to be Facebook friends with someone in Belgium? Will there be a tariff on Skype calls? A tax on email?\nUntil recently, the countries of the world were a bit like colleagues periodically meeting for dinner. With the exception of China and a few others, they all showed up, ate together, and split the check at the end of the night. But as more countries choose to project their local laws onto the internet they are, in effect, choosing to stay home. Each dinner has fewer and fewer guests. That’s what could happen if the internet continues to fragment—a slow separation that eventually ruins the party.<b>📬 Sign up for the Daily Brief</b>Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning."

Article 4 sets out the specific circumstances when this can be done: to prevent terrorist offences and subversive acts and offences against the security of the state; where there is information about a probably attack on a computer system that poses a threat to public order, national defence, state institutions or the national economy; for the purposes of investigations and judicial information where it is difficult to obtain results without electronic surveillance; and in order to execute requests for international mutual legal assistance. Article 4 also states that judicial authorisation is required.\n\nUnder Article 5, an authority conducting the search and seizure of a computer system is empowered to require any person who knows how to operate the computer system or the measures which have been applied to protect the data on the computer, to assist them and provide them with any information necessary to complete their task.

Part 2, Category 5 of the Defence and Strategic Goods List 2021 includes certain forms of encryption such as quantum cryptography algorithms and associated software and technology, in addition to other information security devices and goods.\n\nHowever, the scope of encryption export controls are limited by a number of exemptions. These exclude all cryptographic goods being exported for the user’s personal use, all cryptographic software and technology in the public domain, all cryptographic software and technology that is considered basic scientific research, all cryptographic goods and software that is generally available to the public, and all cryptographic technology that is considered the minimum necessary information for a patent application.

The assessment of reasonableness and proportionality includes consideration of a number of specified factors, including whether the request or notice is “necessary” as well as “the legitimate expectations of the Australian community relating to privacy”. In relation to encryption, a request or notice must not have the effect of “requesting or requiring a designated communications provider to implement or build a systemic weakness, or a systemic vulnerability, into a form of electronic protection” or “preventing a designated communications provider from rectifying a systemic weakness, or a systemic vulnerability, in a form of electronic protection” (section 317ZG(1)).\n\nThe Act explicitly states that such prohibited requests would include any which involve implementing or building new decryption capabilities in relation to a form of electronic protection as well as anything that would render systemic methods of authentication or encryption less effective (sections 317ZG(2) and (3)). Weaknesses and vulnerabilities are systemic if they affect “a whole class of technology” but are not if they are “selectively introduced to one or more target technologies that are connected with a particular person” (section 317B).\n\nFailure to comply with a technical assistance notice or a technical capability notice is an offence, punishable by up to 47,619 penalty units (AUD 9,999,990) if the provider is a body corporate and 238 penalty units (AUD 49,980) if it is not (section 317ZB).\n\nA copy of the Telecommunications Act 1997 can be found <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00495\">here</a>.<b>Obligations on individuals to assist authorities</b>Under section 3LA of the Crimes Act 1914 (inserted by the Australian Cybercrime Act 2001 and amended by the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018), a constable may apply to a magistrate for an order requiring a specified person to provide any information or assistance that is reasonable and necessary to allow the constable to do one or more things in relation to data held in, or accessible from, a computer or data storage device which has been seized, found on a person being searched or is on property being searched under a warrant. These are to be able to access the data, to copy the data; or to convert the data into documentary form or another form intelligible to the constable.\n\nIn order to grant the order, the magistrate must be satisfied of three things. First, that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that evidential material is held in, or is accessible from, the computer or data storage device. Second, that the specified person is reasonably suspected of having committed an offence, the owner or lessee of the computer or device (or an employee of them or a person engaged under a contract for services by them), a person who uses or has used that computer or device, or a person who is or was a system administrated for the system which includes the computer or device. Third, that the specified person has relevant knowledge of the computer or device or of measures applied to protect data held in, or accessible from, the computer or device. This could include knowledge of the password or other means by which the data has been encrypted and how it can be decrypted.\n\nFailure to comply with a requirement in such an order is a criminal offence, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment or 300 penalty units (63,000 AUD) in ordinary cases, and by up to ten years’ imprisonment or 600 penalty units (124,000 AUD) where the order relates to a serious offence or a serious terrorism offence.\n\nThe Crimes Act 1914 can be found <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00486\">here</a>.<b>Other restrictions</b>No known legislation or policies.<b>Active policy processes</b>No known active policy processes.<b>Assessment Text Area</b>Australia’s legal framework contains some restrictions on encryption.

Boudreau-Fontaine (2010 QCCA 1108)</a>, the Quebec Court of Appeal found that an order compelling an individual to provide a password violated his constitutional rights, including his rights to silence and against self-incrimination. Various lower courts have followed this decision, although the Supreme Court of Canada has not ruled on this issue.

The duty is only complied with if every surveillance agency that is authorised under an interception warrant or any other lawful interception authority to intercept telecommunications or services on that network, or the network operator concerned, is able to – amongst other things – identify and intercept telecommunications, and obtain call associated data and the content of those telecommunications (section 10(1)). Network operators must decrypt telecommunications on that operator’s public telecommunications network or telecommunications service if they have been encrypted and the network operators provided that encryption (section 10(3)). However this does not require them to decrypt telecommunications that were encrypted by a product supplied by a person other than the operator and is available to the public, or was supplied by the operator as an agent for that product (section 10(4)). Nor does it require them to ensure that surveillance agencies have the ability to decrypt any telecommunication (section 10(4)).\n\nTogether, these duties mean that network operators cannot design and implement end-to-end encryption.\n\nUnder section 24 of the Act, where a network operator or service provider is shown an interception warrant which has been issued to a surveillance authority, it must assist the surveillance agency. This assistance includes “taking all other reasonable steps that are necessary for the purpose of giving effect to the warrant or lawful authority”, including decrypting telecommunications where they have provided the encryption. As with the duties under sections 9 and 10, this does not, however, require them to decrypt telecommunications that were encrypted by a product supplied by them as an agent for that product, or supplied by another person where the product is available to the public (section 24(4)). Nor does it require them to ensure that surveillance agencies have the ability to decrypt any telecommunication (section 24(4)).\n\nA copy of the law can be found <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2013/0091/latest/DLM5177923.html\">here</a>.\n\nUnder section 130 of the Search and Surveillance Act 2012, a person with a search power in respect of data held in a computer system or other data storage device may require a specified person to provide access information and other information or assistance that is reasonable and necessary to allow the person exercising the search power to access that data.

Regulation 7 allows for a judge to make a warrant authorising or requiring a licensee to (a) intercept any communication as described in the warrant; (b) disclose, in such a manner as may be described in the warrant of such intercepted communication; or (c) assist foreign authorities in accordance with an international mutual assistance agreement.\n\nRegulation 7 also provides that a judge may only issue a warrant where: (i) there is no other lawful means of investigating the matter for which the warrant is required, (ii) where it is necessary it is in the interest of the national security, for the purpose of preventing or investigating a crime, for the purpose of protecting and safeguarding the economic wellbeing of Nigerians, in the interest of public emergency or safety, or to give effect to any international mutual assistance agreements, which Nigeria is a party; and (iii) such information can only be obtained by lawfully intercepting such Communication as specified in the warrant.\n\nRegulation 8 provides that the interception of communications is also lawful where (a) one of the parties to the communication has consented to the interception; (b) it is done by a person who is a party to the communication, and has sufficient reason to believe that there is a threat to human life and safety; and (c) in the ordinary course of business, it is required to record or monitor such communication.\n\nUnder Regulation 9, where a communication intercepted is an encrypted or protected communication within the possession of the licensee, the licensee shall provide relevant security agencies with the key, code or access to the protected or encrypted communication. Where the key or code is in the possession of another person, the relevant security agency must request that person to disclose it. Instead of providing a key or code, a licensee or person may disclose any encrypted or protected communication in an intelligible form.\n\nFailure to comply with a requirement is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to NGN 5,000,000.00, and where the offence continues, an additional daily default penalty of NGN 500,000.00.

Such a notice may impose on the provider any applicable obligations specified, and require them to take all steps specified in order to comply with those obligations. A technical capability notice may be issued if three requirements are met (s. 253(2)).\n\nFirst, the Secretary of State must considers that the notice is necessary to ensure that the provider has the capability to provide any assistance that they may be required to provide in relation to interception, obtaining communications data or equipment interference authorised by the Act (s. 253(1)(a)).\n\nSecond, the Secretary of State must considers that the conduct required by the notice is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by that conduct (s. 253(1)(b)).\n\nThird, the decision to give the notice must have been approved by a Judicial Commissioner. A Judicial Commissioner is a specially appointed judge, and, when deciding whether to approve a notice, must consider whether the notice is necessary and proportionate (s. 253(1)(c)).\n\nThe obligations that can be included in a technical capability notice are to set out in secondary legislation, the Investigatory Powers (Technical Capability) Regulations 2018. While the Regulations don’t explicitly refer to the ability to decrypt communications, they do include the capability to “disclose the content of communications or secondary data in an intelligible form where reasonably practicable” and to “remove electronic protection applied by or on behalf of the telecommunications operator to the communications or data where reasonably practicable”.\n\nWhere the Secretary of State is considering whether to issue a notice which requires the removal of electronic protection, they must take into account the technical feasibility and likely cost of compliance. (s. 255(4)).\n\nFailure to comply with obligations in a technical capability notice is not a criminal offence, but can be enforced through the civil courts.\n\nSection 49 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 contains powers for the security and law enforcement agencies in relation to “protected information” i.e. electronic data which, without the key to the data, cannot, or cannot readily, be accessed or put into an intelligible form.\n\nWhere protected information has come into the hands of an agency, they may, usually with a requirement for written permission from a judge, impose a disclosure requirement upon a person if they reasonably believe that:\n\n<ul><li>a key to the protected information is in the possession of a person;</li>\n<li>that a disclosure requirement in respect of the protected information is necessary in the interests of national security, for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime, in the interests of the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, or to secure the effective exercise or proper performance of any statutory power or duty;</li>\n<li>that a disclosure requirement is proportionate to what is sought to be achieved by its imposition; and</li>\n<li>it is not reasonably for the person with the appropriate permission to obtain possession of the protected information in an intelligible form without a disclosure requirement.</li></ul>\nUnder section 50, where a disclosure requirement has been made, the person to whom it is directed must use any key in his possession to obtain access to the information, or to put it into an intelligible form, and make a disclosure of the information in an intelligible form. Alternatively, the person can disclosure the key itself.\n\nFailure to comply with a disclosure requirement is a criminal offence punishable in ordinary cases by imprisonment of up to two years’, a fine, or both.

After the…\n<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/build/guidebook/\"><img />\t\t\t\t\t<b>Update: see the Guidebook to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for current implementation details.</b></a>\n\n\nToday, Congress passed the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), a once-in-a-generation investment in our nation’s infrastructure and competitiveness. For far too long, Washington policymakers have celebrated “infrastructure week” without ever agreeing to build infrastructure. The President promised to work across the aisle to deliver results and rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. After the President put forward his plan to do exactly that and then negotiated a deal with Members of Congress from both parties, this historic legislation is moving to his desk for signature.\n\n\n\n\nThis Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will rebuild America’s roads, bridges and rails, expand access to clean drinking water, ensure every American has access to high-speed internet, tackle the climate crisis, advance environmental justice, and invest in communities that have too often been left behind. The legislation will help ease inflationary pressures and strengthen supply chains by making long overdue improvements for our nation’s ports, airports, rail, and roads. It will drive the creation of good-paying union jobs and grow the economy sustainably and equitably so that everyone gets ahead for decades to come. Combined with the President’s Build Back Framework, it will add on average <a href=\"https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/macroeconomic-consequences-of-the-infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-and-build-back-better-framework.pdf\">1.5 million jobs per year</a> for the next 10 years.\n\nThis historic legislation will:\n\n\n\n\n<b>Deliver clean water to all American families and eliminate the nation’s lead service lines.</b> Currently, up to 10 million American households and 400,000 schools and child care centers lack safe drinking water. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will invest $55 billion to expand access to clean drinking water for households, businesses, schools, and child care centers all across the country. From rural towns to struggling cities, the legislation will invest in water infrastructure and eliminate lead service pipes, including in Tribal Nations and disadvantaged communities that need it most.\n\n\n\n\n<b>Ensure every American has access to reliable high-speed internet.</b>Broadband internet is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet, by one definition, more than 30 million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds – a particular problem in rural communities throughout the country. And, according to the latest OECD data, among 35 countries studied, the United States has the second highest broadband costs. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will deliver $65 billion to help ensure that every American has access to reliable high-speed internet through a historic investment in broadband infrastructure deployment. The legislation will also help lower prices for internet service and help close the digital divide, so that more Americans can afford internet access.\n\n<b>Repair and rebuild our roads and bridges with a focus on climate change mitigation, resilience, equity, and safety for all users.</b> In the United States, 1 in 5 miles of highways and major roads, and 45,000 bridges, are in poor condition. The legislation will reauthorize surface transportation programs for five years and invest $110 billion in additional funding to repair our roads and bridges and support major, transformational projects. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal makes the single largest investment in repairing and reconstructing our nation’s bridges since the construction of the interstate highway system. It will rebuild the most economically significant bridges in the country as well as thousands of smaller bridges. The legislation also includes the first ever Safe Streets and Roads for All program to support projects to reduce traffic fatalities, which claimed more than 20,000 lives in the first half of 2021.\n\n\n\n\n<b>Improve transportation options for millions of Americans and reduce greenhouse emissions through the largest investment in public transit in U.S. history.</b> America’s public transit infrastructure is inadequate – with a multibillion-dollar repair backlog, representing more than 24,000 buses, 5,000 rail cars, 200 stations, and thousands of miles of track, signals, and power systems in need of replacement. Communities of color are twice as likely to take public transportation and many of these communities lack sufficient public transit options. The transportation sector in the United States is now the largest single source of greenhouse gas emissions. The legislation includes $39 billion of new investment to modernize transit, in addition to continuing the existing transit programs for five years as part of surface transportation reauthorization.  In total, the new investments and reauthorization in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal provide $89.9 billion in guaranteed funding for public transit over the next five years — the largest Federal investment in public transit in history. The legislation will expand public transit options across every state in the country, replace thousands of deficient transit vehicles, including buses, with clean, zero emission vehicles, and improve accessibility for the elderly and people with disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n<b>Upgrade our nation’s airports and ports to strengthen our supply chains and prevent disruptions that have caused inflation. This will improve U.S. competitiveness, create more and better jobs at these hubs, and reduce emissions.</b>Decades of neglect and underinvestment in our infrastructure have left the links in our goods movement supply chains struggling to keep up with our strong economic recovery from the pandemic. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal will make the fundamental changes that are long overdue for our nation’s ports and airports so this will not happen again. The United States built modern aviation, but our airports lag far behind our competitors. According to some rankings, no U.S. airports rank in the top 25 of airports worldwide. Our ports and waterways need repair and reimagination too. The legislation invests $17 billion in port infrastructure and waterways and $25 billion in airports to address repair and maintenance backlogs, reduce congestion and emissions near ports and airports, and drive electrification and other low-carbon technologies. Modern, resilient, and sustainable port, airport, and freight infrastructure will strengthen our supply chains and support U.S. competitiveness by removing bottlenecks and expediting commerce and reduce the environmental impact on neighboring communities.\n\n\n\n\n<b>Make the largest investment in passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak.</b> U.S. passenger rail lags behind the rest of the world in reliability, speed, and coverage. China already has 22,000 miles of high-speed rail, and is planning to double that by 2035. The legislation positions rail to play a central role in our transportation and economic future, investing $66 billion in additional rail funding to eliminate the Amtrak maintenance backlog, modernize the Northeast Corridor, and bring world-class rail service to areas outside the northeast and mid-Atlantic. This is the largest investment in passenger rail since Amtrak’s creation, 50 years ago and will create safe, efficient, and climate-friendly alternatives for moving people and freight.\n\n\n\n\n<b>Build a national network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers.</b> U.S. market share of plug-in EV sales is only one-third the size of the Chinese EV market. That needs to change. The legislation will invest $7.5 billion to build out a national network of EV chargers in the United States. This is a critical step in the President’s strategy to fight the climate crisis and it will create good U.S. manufacturing jobs. The legislation will provide funding for deployment of EV chargers along highway corridors to facilitate long-distance travel and within communities to provide convenient charging where people live, work, and shop. This investment will support the President’s goal of building a nationwide network of 500,000 EV chargers to accelerate the adoption of EVs, reduce emissions, improve air quality, and create good-paying jobs across the country.\n\n\n\n\n<b>Upgrade our power infrastructure to deliver clean, reliable energy across the country and deploy cutting-edge energy technology to achieve a zero-emissions future.</b>According to the Department of Energy, power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $70 billion annually. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal’s more than $65 billion investment includes the largest investment in clean energy transmission and grid in American history. It will upgrade our power infrastructure, by building thousands of miles of new, resilient transmission lines to facilitate the expansion of renewables and clean energy, while lowering costs. And it will fund new programs to support the development, demonstration, and deployment of cutting-edge clean energy technologies to accelerate our transition to a zero-emission economy. \n\n<b>Make our infrastructure resilient against the impacts of climate change, cyber-attacks, and extreme weather events.</b> Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change each year when their roads wash out, power goes down, or schools get flooded. Last year alone, the United States faced 22 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each – a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. People of color are more likely to live in areas most vulnerable to flooding and other climate change-related weather events. The legislation makes our communities safer and our infrastructure more resilient to the impacts of climate change and cyber-attacks, with an investment of over $50 billion to protect against droughts, heat, floods and wildfires, in addition to a major investment in weatherization. The legislation is the largest investment in the resilience of physical and natural systems in American history.\n\n<b>Deliver the largest investment in tackling legacy pollution in American history by cleaning up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaiming abandoned mines, and capping orphaned oil and gas wells.</b> In thousands of rural and urban communities around the country, hundreds of thousands of former industrial and energy sites are now idle – sources of blight and pollution. Proximity to a Superfund site can lead to elevated levels of lead in children’s blood. The bill will invest $21 billion clean up Superfund and brownfield sites, reclaim abandoned mine land and cap orphaned oil and gas wells. These projects will remediate environmental harms, address the legacy pollution that harms the public health of communities, create good-paying union jobs, and advance long overdue environmental justice This investment will benefit communities of color as, it has been found that 26% of Black Americans and 29% of Hispanic Americans live within 3 miles of a Superfund site, a higher percentage than for Americans overall.\n\n\n\n\n###"

I’ve come across scores, citing Finland, Estonia, France, Spain, Greece, Costa Rica, and the European Union, without however citing the laws that have actually proclaimed these rights.\n\nIn an attempt to verify whether the proclaimed rights became entrenched in any Constitution, or whether any other law stipulated – in black on white – that Internet access was a citizen’s legal right, the following (in chronological order) are the results of my research into these countries’ legislative frameworks and court decisions:\n\n<b>1.</b><b>Estonia</b>\n\nIn February 2000, the Estonian Riigikogu (Parliament) enacted the new <a href=\"https://www.legaltext.ee/en/andmebaas/ava.asp?m=022\">Telecommunications Act</a>, <b>adding Internet access to its universal service list:</b>\n\n\nArticle 5.  ‘The set of telecommunications services specified in subsection (1) of this section comprises:\n\n2) Internet service which universally available to all subscribers regardless of their geographical location, at a uniform price.’\n\nThis <a href=\"https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/0,1518,488083,00.html\">2007 interview</a> with Estonian former prime minister Mart Laar, on Spiegel Online, describes how all four corners of the country became connected through a robust infrastructure. This blog post (three years later, in June 2010) confirms that wireless coverage – mostly free of charge – reached enviable extents, and explains how the Tiigrihüpe(or Tiger Leap) project helped in the expansion of the network infrastructure in the country.\n\n<b>2.</b><b>Greece</b>\n\nA year later, Greece amended its <a href=\"https://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf\">Constitution</a> with the introduction of, among other provisions, Article 5A and in particular its second paragraph:\n\n‘2. All persons have the right to participate in the Information Society. <b>Facilitation of access to electronically transmitted information, as well as of the production, exchange and diffusion thereof, constitutes an obligation of the State</b>, always in observance of the guarantees of articles 9, 9A and 19.’\n\nThe Resolution of 6 April 2001 (G) is in Volume 1 (Constitutional Law) on the E-Themis Online Legislation Portal. It was published in Gazette A/17.4.2001 84.\n\n<b>3.</b><b>European Union</b>\n\nIn the European Union, on 25 November 2009, after <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5563642\">two years of legislative drafting</a>, Directive 2009/136/EC of the European Parliament and Council entered into force. Among other directives, the 2009 Directive amended Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic communications networks and services.\n\nThe amendment replaced Article 4 of the 2002 Directive, part of which reads:\n\n<b>‘Provision of access at a fixed location</b> and provision of telephone services\n\n1.  Member States shall ensure that <b>all reasonable requests for connection at a fixed location to a public communications network are met by at least one undertaking</b>.\n\n2.  The connection provided shall be capable of supporting voice, facsimile and data communications at data rates that are sufficient to permit functional Internet access, taking into account prevailing technologies used by the majority of subscribers and technological feasibility…’\n\nEU member states are obliged to transpose the Directive to national law by 25 May 2011. Meanwhile, on 2 March 2010, the European Commission <a href=\"https://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/10/218&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en\">launched a public consultation</a> (which <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/library/public_consult/universal_service_2010/index_en.htm\">ended on 7 May 2010</a> after receiving a substantial amount of <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/policy/ecomm/library/public_consult/universal_service_2010/comments/index_en.htm\">responses</a>), to analyse whether the universal service obligations should be extended to broadband access. A few days later, the European Commission launched the <a href=\"https://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/200&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en\">Digital Agenda for Europe action plan</a>, whereby one of the targets is to ‘Ensure that by 2020 all Europeans can have access to much faster internet, as set out in the EU targets. In 2010 The European Commission will present a communication on broadband which will lay out a common framework for actions at EU and Member State level…’ The 2010 communication (COM(2010) 472) is available <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/broadband/docs/bb_communication.pdf\">here</a>.\n\n<b>4.</b><b>France</b>\n\nIn France, on 10 June 2009, the Conseil Constitutionnel (<b>Constitutional Council</b>) declared that (Article 12 of <a href=\"https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/2009_580dc.pdf\">the decision</a>): ‘given the generalized development of public online communication services and the importance of the latter for the participation in democracy and the expression of ideas and opinions’, <b>the free communication of ideas and opinions enshrined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen of 1789 implied freedom to access such services</b>.\n\nThe Constitutional Council also said the law breached privacy by enabling the Haute Autorité pour la Diffusion des Œuvres et la Protection des Droits sur Internet (HADOPI) to track people’s internet activity.\n\nThe decision was in reference to the HADOPI law, or the infamous ‘three strikes’ law. The June 2009 decision <a href=\"https://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article6478542.ece\">was an embarrassing blow</a>, which had rendered the HADOPI law toothless.\n\nA few months later, however, a revised version of the HADOPI law <a href=\"https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/en2009_590dc.pdf\">was approved by the Constitutional Council</a> (see Articles 16-25). The revision allowed the revocation of a person’s Internet access for a maximum period of one year (<a href=\"https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=48D2EBB503602FAD8240093AAD2657E7.tpdjo05v_1?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&idArticle=LEGIARTI000006279194&dateTexte=20110429&categorieLien=cid#LEGIARTI000006279194\">L335-7</a>) which however could only be imposed after judicial review (<a href=\"https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=C3EF5E29C5023CBEDCAE080C107802E3.tpdjo05v_1?idArticle=LEGIARTI000021212160&cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069414&dateTexte=20100616\">L335-7-2</a>).\n\n<b>5.</b><b>Finland</b>\n\nFinland followed suit last year when it declared broadband access a basic right in Finland. The right was proclaimed via an amendment in the Communications Market Act, which stated that<b>universal service also included a functional Internet connection</b>. This meant that as from the beginning of July 2010, the telecom operators that are ‘defined as universal service providers must be able to provide every permanent residence and business office with access to a reasonably priced and high-quality connection with a downstream rate of at least 1 Mbit/s.’\n\nThe relevant provision is Section 60 C of the <a href=\"https://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2003/en20030393.pdf\">Communications Market Act</a>, and the responsibility of <a href=\"https://www.viestintavirasto.fi/en/index/internet/laajakaista/yleispalvelu.html\">designating operators as universal service operators</a> falls is that of the Finish Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (FICORA). This target of making a connection available throughout the country was reached in 2010.\n\n<b>6.</b><b>Costa Rica</b>\n\nIn Costa Rica, the Sala Constitucional(Constitutional Court) <a href=\"https://200.91.68.20/scij/busqueda/jurisprudencia/jur_repartidor.asp?param1=XYZ&param2=1&nValor1=1&nValor2=483874&strTipM=T&lResultado=1\">decided on 30 July 2010</a> that <b>the government’s delay in opening the telecoms market to competition was tantamount to a breach of fundamental freedoms</b>:\n\n‘Based on the foregoing, the Constitutional Court concludes that the delay in opening verified telecommunications market has not only violated the right enshrined in Article 41 of the Constitution but also has affected the exercise and enjoyment of other fundamental rights such as freedom of choice of consumers as enshrined in Article 46, paragraph in fine constitutional right of access to new information technologies, the right to equality and the eradication of the digital divide (info-exclusion )-Article 33 of the Constitution-the right to access the internet through the interface that the user or consumer choice and free enterprise and trade.’ (Translated using <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/\">Google’s Translation Service</a>.

This international survey is carried out on a basis of laws and regulations in each country, with Internet addiction or PUI as a direct or indirect scope. This has resulted early 2020 in the identification and summarization of a catalogue of 66 laws or regulations from 50 countries, each described in template form. The identified laws and regulations are analysed with respect to specific consequences of the Internet addictions, as well as by categories of stakeholders addressed in these measures."

Please read the Agreement carefully.\nA. INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES\nThis Agreement governs your use of Apple’s Services (“Services” – e.g., and where available, App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News, Apple News+, Apple One, Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Game Center, iTunes), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, Apps (as defined below), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”). Content may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party. Our Services are available for your use in your country or territory of residence (“Home Country”). By creating an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory you are specifying it as your Home Country. To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply). Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.\nB. USING OUR SERVICES\nPAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUNDS\nYou can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction.” Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple, and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for some Content you acquire from Apple Books, Apple Podcasts, or App Store as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service. In such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc.). When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions. On applicable Apple hardware, if you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition. Manage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT204030\">https://support.apple.com/HT204030</a>.\nApple will charge your selected payment method for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes. If you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay. You can associate multiple payment methods with your Apple ID, and you agree that Apple may store and charge those payment methods for Transactions. Your primary payment method appears at the top of your account settings payments page.\nIf your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize Apple to attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods in order from top to bottom as they appear on your account settings payments page. If we cannot charge you, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you provide another payment method. If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content’s availability). In accordance with local law, Apple may automatically update your payment information regarding your payment methods if provided such information by the payment networks or your financial institutions. Terms related to store credit and gift cards/codes are available here: <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/\">https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/</a>. For more details about how Transactions are billed, please visit <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/HT201359\">http://support.apple.com/HT</a><a href=\"http://support.apple.com/HT201359\">201359</a>. All Transactions are final. Content prices may change at any time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple. From time to time, Apple may suspend or cancel payment or refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, abuse, or unlawful or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.\nACCOUNT\nUsing our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple ID. An Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem. Use of Game Center is subject to this Agreement and also requires a Game Center account. Your account is valuable, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security. Apple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your account. Please contact Apple if you suspect that your account has been compromised.\nYou must be age 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country, as set forth in the Apple ID creation process) to create an account and use our Services. Apple IDs for persons under this age can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution. A parent or legal guardian who is creating an account for a minor should review this Agreement with the minor to ensure that they both understand it.\nYou may add, notify, or remove a Legacy Contact for your Apple ID as described in http://support.apple.com/HT212360. A Legacy Contact’s access to your Apple ID is limited as described in <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/HT212361\">http://support.apple.com/HT212361</a>.\nPRIVACY\nYour use of our Services is subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy, which is available at <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/\">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a>.\nSERVICES AND CONTENT USAGE RULES\nYour use of the Services and Content must follow the rules set forth in this section (“Usage Rules”).

Each computer must also be authorized using the same Apple ID (to learn more about authorization of computers, visit <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT201251\">https://support.apple.com/HT201251</a>). Devices can be associated with a different Apple ID once every 90 days.\n- Manipulating play counts, downloads, ratings, or reviews via any means — such as (i) using a bot, script, or automated process; or (ii) providing or accepting any kind of compensation or incentive — is prohibited.\n- It is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage Content once downloaded. We encourage you to back up your Content regularly.\n- You may not tamper with or circumvent any security technology included with the Services or Content.\n- You may access our Services only using Apple’s software, and may not modify or use modified versions of such software.\n- Video Content requires an HDCP connection.\nAudio and Video Content Sales and Rentals:\n- You can use Digital Rights Management (DRM)-free Content on a reasonable number of compatible devices that you own or control. DRM-protected Content can be used on up to five computers and any number of devices that you sync to from those computers.\n- Content rentals are viewable on a single device at a time, and must be played within 30 days, and completed within 48 hours of the start of play (stopping, pausing or restarting does not extend this period).\n- You may burn an audio playlist of purchased music to disc for listening purposes up to seven times; this limitation does not apply to DRM-free Content. Other Content may not be burned to disc.\n- Purchased Content will generally remain available for you to download, redownload, or otherwise access from Apple. Though it is unlikely, subsequent to your purchase, Content may be removed from the Services (for instance, because the provider removed it) and become unavailable for further download or access from Apple. To ensure your ability to continue enjoying Content, we encourage you to download all purchased Content to a device in your possession and to back it up.\nApp Store Content:\n- The term “Apps” includes apps and App Clips for any Apple platform and/or operating system, including any in-app purchases, extensions (such as keyboards), stickers, and subscriptions made available in such apps or App Clips.\n- Individuals acting on behalf of a commercial enterprise, governmental organization or educational institution (an “Enterprise”) may download and sync non-Arcade Apps for use by either (i) a single individual on one or more devices owned or controlled by an Enterprise; or (ii) multiple individuals on a single shared device owned or controlled by an Enterprise. For the sake of clarity, each device used serially or collectively by multiple users requires a separate license.\nApple Music:\n- An Individual Apple Music membership allows you to stream on a single device at a time; a Family membership allows you or your Family members to stream on up to six devices at a time.\nApple Arcade:\n- Apple Arcade Apps may only be downloaded, or redownloaded, with a valid Apple Arcade trial or subscription.\n- If your subscription ends, Apps downloaded via Apple Arcade will no longer be accessible to you.\nApple TV Content:\n- For most channels, you can stream video Content on up to three devices simultaneously.\n- Learn more about Apple TV Content Usage Rules at <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT210074\">https://support.apple.com/HT210074</a>.\nDOWNLOADS\nYou may be limited in the amount of Content you may download, and some downloaded Content may expire after a given amount of time after downloaded or first played. Certain Content may not be available for download at all.\nYou may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (“Redownload”) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (“Associated Devices”). You can see Content types available for Redownload in your Home Country at <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT204632\">https://support.apple.com/HT204632</a>. Content may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.\nContent also may be removed from our Services at any time (for instance, because the provider removed it), after which it cannot be downloaded, redownloaded, or otherwise accessed from Apple.\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nThe Services and certain Apps may allow you to purchase access to Content or Services on a subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”). Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. To learn more about cancelling your subscriptions, visit <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT202039\">https://support.apple.com/HT202039</a>. You will be notified if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, your consent will be required to continue. You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period. If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information. This may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period, as displayed on your receipt. We reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription. Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the free trial ends.\nIf you start a free trial to a Paid Subscription offered by Apple as Content provider (an “Apple Paid Subscription”) and cancel before it ends, you cannot reactivate the free trial.\nFree trials or free offers to Apple Paid Subscriptions, excluding iCloud, cannot be combined with any free trials or offers of Apple One. If you are in a free trial or free offer for any Apple Paid Subscriptions, and you subscribe to Apple One, your free trial(s) or offer(s) will not be paused even if you have access to such Apple Paid Subscription(s) through your Apple One subscription. You acknowledge that your free trial or free offer may expire while you are a Paid Subscriber to Apple One, and Apple shall have no obligation to reinstate, reimburse, or otherwise compensate you for any part of such expired free trial or free offer.\nWhen your Paid Subscription to any Service or Content ends, you will lose access to any functionality or Content of that Service that requires a Paid Subscription.\nCONTENT AND SERVICE AVAILABILITY\nTerms found in this Agreement that relate to Services, Content types, features or functionality not available in your Home Country are not applicable to you unless and until they become available to you. To see the Content types available to you in your Home Country, go to the Services or visit <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT204411\">https://support.apple.com/HT204411</a>. Certain Services and Content available to you in your Home Country may not be available to you when traveling outside of your Home Country.\nTHIRD-PARTY DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT\nYou may not be able to use all features of the Services when accessing them on a non-Apple-branded device. Additionally, certain Services may require, direct, or suggest you use third-party equipment in some circumstances and/or for certain activities; such use is subject to the terms and conditions of such equipment and should be made in accordance with the applicable manufacturer’s instructions. By using the Services, you agree that Apple may automatically download and install minor updates to its software on third-party equipment from time to time.\nC. YOUR SUBMISSIONS TO OUR SERVICES\nOur Services may allow you to submit or post materials such as comments, ratings and reviews, pictures, videos, and podcasts (including associated metadata and artwork). Your use of such features must comply with the Submissions Guidelines below, which may be updated from time to time, and if we become aware of materials that violate our Submission Guidelines we will remove them. If you see materials that do not comply with the Submissions Guidelines, please use the Report a Concern feature. Except to the extent prohibited by law, you hereby grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, nonexclusive license to use the materials you submit within the Services and related marketing as well as to use the materials you submit for Apple internal purposes. Apple may monitor and decide to remove or edit any submitted material.\nSubmissions Guidelines: You may not use the Services to:\n- post any materials that (i) you do not have permission, right or license to use, or (ii) infringe on the rights of any third party;\n- post objectionable, offensive, unlawful, deceptive, inaccurate, or harmful content;\n- post personal, private or confidential information belonging to others;\n- request personal information from a minor;\n- impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with another person, or entity;\n- post or transmit spam, including but not limited to unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials, or informational announcements;\n- post, modify, or remove a rating or review in exchange for any kind of compensation or incentive;\n- post a dishonest, abusive, harmful, misleading, or bad-faith rating or review, or a rating or review that is irrelevant to the Content being reviewed;\n- plan or engage in any illegal, fraudulent, or manipulative activity.\nD. FAMILY SHARING\nThe organizer of a Family (“Organizer”) must be 18 years (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country) or older and the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country as set forth in the registration process). Apple devices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features. Family Sharing allows eligible subscriptions to be shared among up to six members of a Family. To learn more about Family Sharing visit: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT201060\">https://support.apple.com/HT201060</a>.\nPurchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows eligible Content to be shared among up to six members of a Family. The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer's eligible payment methods are used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s eligible payment methods are used. The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such Transactions; (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized; and (3) Transactions will be charged to eligible payment methods in the manner indicated in Section B above. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contracts, and assume all risk related to sharing access to their eligible payment methods with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and, if billed to the Organizer’s payment method, also to the Organizer.\nAsk to Buy: Ask to Buy is a feature that allows an Organizer to approve Transactions initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country). Content shared by Family members or acquired via content codes generally is not subject to Ask to Buy; content codes facilitating access to subscriptions are subject to Ask to Buy. The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is enabled by default for any Family member under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country) and stays on until deactivated by the parent or legal guardian. If Ask to Buy is turned off after the Family member turns 18 years old, it cannot be turned on anymore. Ask to Buy does not require Purchase Sharing to be enabled.\nFamily Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the former member’s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer’s payment method.\nFamily Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple ID you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for Purchase Sharing. Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Apple One Family, Apple One Premier, Apple Music Family, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for Family Sharing. Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.\nE. SEASON PASS AND MULTI-PASS\nA Pass allows you to purchase and receive television Content as it becomes available. A Season Pass applies to television Content that has a limited number of episodes per season; a Multi-Pass applies to television Content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a Season Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the Transaction. Season Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available. If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Apple ID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple.\nF. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING APPLE ARCADE APPS)\nLICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT\nApp licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”). Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in operating the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App;” an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App.” Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”). The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App, subject to local law. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement. Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.\nIN-APP PURCHASES\nApps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”). In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID. You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you have asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT201304\">https://support.apple.com/HT201304</a>.\nAPP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT\nApple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law. App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.\nAPP BUNDLES\nSome Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”). The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.\nSEARCH RESULTS AND RANKINGS\nWhen determining how to order the Apps in search results, the main parameters considered are the metadata provided by App Providers, how customers have engaged with the Apps and the App Store, and the popularity of the Apps in the App Store. These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.\nLICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT\nApps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the App Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided.

ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR CONTENT ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES\nSome Content available in Apple Books, App Store, and Apple Podcasts (including Apple Podcasts Subscriptions) are acquired by you from the third-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple. In such case, Apple acts as an agent for the Content provider in providing the Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Content provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for the Content you acquire, but such Content is licensed by the Content provider. The Content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such Content. The Content provider is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Content.\nH. ADDITIONAL APPLE MUSIC TERMS\niCloud Music Library is an Apple Music feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store or another source (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your Apple Music-enabled devices. iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership. iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content. This information is associated with your Apple ID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music. iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple). You can upload up to 100,000 songs. Songs acquired from the iTunes Store do not count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Library, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use, and the time and duration of playback. You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content. iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should back up your data and information prior to using iCloud Music Library. If you are not an Apple Music member, you may purchase an iTunes Match subscription, which uses iCloud Music Library.

CARRIER MEMBERSHIP\nWhere available, you may be offered to purchase a Service membership from your wireless carrier (a “Carrier Membership”). If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier is the merchant of record, which means that you acquire the Service license from your carrier, which will bill you for the cost of your Service membership, but the Service is licensed and provided by Apple. Your purchase relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not Apple. By using a Service through a Carrier Membership, you agree that your carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number and subscription information with Apple, and that Apple may use this information to determine the status of your Carrier Membership.\nK.

    "result": " The Global Drive to Control Big Tech\nRead Freedom House’s annual survey & analysis of internet freedom around the world in the Freedom on the Net 2021 report— The Global Drive to Control Big Tech.\nWritten by\n        Adrian Shahbaz\n      \n        Allie Funk\n\n            <b>KeyFindings</b>\n\n<b><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech#Internet\">Global internet freedom declined for the 11th consecutive year.</a></b>The greatest deteriorations were documented in Myanmar, Belarus, and Uganda, where state forces cracked down amid electoral and constitutional crises. Myanmar’s 14-point score decline is the largest registered since the Freedom on the Net project began.\n\n\n<b><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech#Regulation\">Governments clashed with technology companies on users’ rights.</a></b>Authorities<b></b>in at least 48 countries pursued new rules for tech companies on content, data, and competition over the past year. With a few positive exceptions, the push to regulate the tech industry, which stems in some cases from genuine problems like online harassment and manipulative market practices, is being exploited to subdue free expression and gain greater access to private data.\n\n\n<b><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech#Key\">Free expression online is under unprecedented strain.</a></b>More governments arrested users for nonviolent political, social, or religious speech than ever before. Officials suspended internet access in at least 20 countries, and 21 states blocked access to social media platforms. Authorities in at least 45 countries are suspected of obtaining sophisticated spyware or data-extraction technology from private vendors.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-net/2021\"><b>China ranks as the worst environment for internet freedom for the seventh year in a row.</b></a>Chinese authorities imposed draconian prison terms for online dissent, independent reporting, and mundane daily communications. The COVID-19 pandemic remains one of the most heavily censored topics. Officials also cracked down on the country’s tech giants, citing their abuses related to competition and data protection, though the campaign further concentrated power in the hands of the authoritarian state.\n\n\n<b><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-states/freedom-net/2021\">The United States’ score declined for the fifth consecutive year.</a></b>False, misleading, and manipulated information continued to proliferate online, even affecting public acceptance of the 2020 presidential election results. The new administration took promising steps to enforce stronger protections for internet users.\n\n\n<b><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech/policy-recommendations\">State intervention must protect human rights online and preserve an open internet.</a></b>The emancipatory power of the internet depends on its egalitarian nature. To counter digital authoritarianism, democracies should ensure that regulations enable users to express themselves freely, share information across borders, and hold the powerful to account.\n\n                In the high-stakes battle between states and technology companies, the rights of internet users have become the main casualties. A growing number of governments are asserting their authority over tech firms, often forcing the businesses to comply with online censorship and surveillance. These developments have contributed to an unprecedented assault on free expression online, causing global internet freedom to decline for an 11th consecutive year.\n\n\nGlobal norms have shifted dramatically toward greater government intervention in the digital sphere. Of the 70 states covered by this report, a total of 48 pursued legal or administrative action against technology companies. While some moves reflected legitimate attempts to mitigate online harms, rein in misuse of data, or end manipulative market practices, many new laws imposed excessively broad censorship and data-collection requirements on the private sector. Users’ online activities are now more pervasively moderated and monitored by companies through processes that lack the safeguards featured in democratic governance, such as transparency, judicial oversight, and public accountability.\n\n\nThe drive toward national regulation has emerged partly due to a failure to address online harms through self-regulation. The United States played a leading role in shaping early internet norms around free speech and free markets, but its laissez-faire approach to the tech industry created opportunities for authoritarian manipulation, data exploitation, and widespread malfeasance. In the absence of a shared global vision for a free and open internet, governments are adopting their own approaches to policing the digital sphere. Policymakers in many countries have cited a vague need to retake control of the internet from foreign powers, multinational corporations, and in some cases, civil society.\n\n\nThis shift in power from companies to states has come amida record-breaking crackdown on freedom of expression online. In 56 countries, officials arrested or convicted people for their online speech.Governments suspended internet access in at least 20 countries, and 21 states blocked access to social media platforms, most often during times of political turmoil such as protests and elections. As digital repression intensifies and expands to more countries,users understandably lack confidence that government initiatives to regulate the internet will lead to greater protection of their rights.\n\n              \n  <b>Explore the Report</b>\n\n  <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech#Internet\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>The Continued Assault on Internet Freedom</b></a>\n            \n            See a rundown of global findings and prominent changes to countries’ internet freedom scores.\n          <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech#Regulation\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>The Promise and Peril of State Regulation</b></a>\n            \n            Global norms have shifted toward greater state intervention in the digital market.\n          <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech/policy-recommendations\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Policy Recommendations</b></a>\n            \n            Learn how policymakers, companies, and civil society can protect global internet freedom.\n\n\n                <b><b>Enlisting the private sector in state abuses</b></b>\n\nThe recent burst of regulatory action can be sorted into three categories pertaining to online content, personal data, and market behavior. Many of the new measures in each category could threaten the interests of users.\n\n\nMore governments have introduced problematic rules on removing users’ speech from internet platforms. Some of the laws are designed to suppress content that is critical of the government, rather than protecting users from harmful material. Others water down due process standards by eliminating the need for a court order or mandating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for content removal, both of which can result in significant collateral damage for political, social, and religious expression. Only in a few cases do such laws require companies to undertake meaningful transparency reporting and provide content producers with an avenue for appeal. Users are increasingly left on their own to contend with companies’ murky moderation systems and protect their rights online.\n\n\nA similar pattern is apparent on matters of data management. A growing number of laws facilitate government surveillance by undermining encryption and mandating that platforms store user data on servers based within the country. These localization requirements leave data especially vulnerable in settings with weak rule-of-law standards, and make it more difficult for companies to offer transnational services with strong cybersecurity features. Even laws that enshrine the rights of users to control their data often contain vague exemptions for national security, while others impose onerous licensing requirements on both local and foreign companies.\n\n\nIndustry regulators around the world have shown a shared zeal for cracking down on anticompetitive and abusive commercial practices. Major tech firms have received massive fines for failing to protect data and exploiting their market power to promote their own products. In a few countries, authorities worked with companies to make competing products interoperable and to allow users to switch among them more seamlessly. However, authoritarian regimes like those in China and Russia have taken heavy-handed actions with little regard for due process or the rule of law, reflecting a desire to further subordinate the private sector to the repressive political interests of the state.\n\n\n<b><b>Harnessing technology for democratic values</b></b>\n\nThere is still time for democratic governments to pursue smart, narrowly tailored measures to protect users’ rights online. Democracies should push for greater transparency and accountability regarding platforms’ content moderation practices. Data privacy laws should focus on protecting users while preventing greater fragmentation of the internet. And competition policy should foster innovation that responds to user demand for greater personalization, security, and interoperability. Regulation should ensure that powerdoes not accumulate in the hands of a few dominant actors, whether in government or the private sector.\n\n\nThe emancipatory power of the internet depends on its egalitarian nature. Wherever a user is based, a free and open internet should offer equal access to educational, creative, and communicative tools that facilitate personal and societal progress. Democratic governments have an obligation to craft regulations that enable users to express themselves freely, share information across borders, and hold the powerful to account. Otherwise, new technologies may serve to reinforce and hasten democracy’s global decline.\n\n                <b>The Continued Assault on Internet Freedom</b>\n\n<b>A rundown of global findings and prominent changes to countries’ internet freedom scores</b>\n\nGlobal internet freedom declined for the 11th consecutive year. The environment for human rights online deteriorated in 30 countries this year, while only 18 countries registered net gains. The largest decline occurred in <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/myanmar/freedom-net/2021\">Myanmar</a>, followed by <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/belarus/freedom-net/2021\">Belarus</a> and <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/uganda/freedom-net/2021\">Uganda</a>. <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/ecuador/freedom-net/2021\">Ecuador</a> experienced the largest improvement, followed by <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/gambia/freedom-net/2021\">The Gambia</a>. The <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-states/freedom-net/2021\">United States</a> ranked 12th overall, while Iceland was once again the top performer. For the seventh consecutive year, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-net/2021\">China</a> was found to have the worst conditions for internet freedom.\n\n\nFreedom on the Netis an annual study of human rights in the digital sphere. The project assesses internet freedom in 70 countries, accounting for 88 percent of the world’s internet users. This report, the 11th in its series, covered developments between June 2020 and May 2021. More than 80 analysts and advisers contributed to this year’s edition, using a standard methodology to determine each country’s internet freedom score on a 100-point scale, with 21 separate indicators pertaining to obstacles to access, limits on content, and violations of user rights. The 2021 edition includes six new countries: <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/costa-rica/freedom-net/2021\">Costa Rica</a>, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/ghana/freedom-net/2021\">Ghana</a>, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/iraq/freedom-net/2021\">Iraq</a>, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/nicaragua/freedom-net/2021\">Nicaragua</a>, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/serbia/freedom-net/2021\">Serbia</a>, and <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/taiwan/freedom-net/2021\">Taiwan</a>. The Freedom on the Netwebsite features in-depth reports and data on each country’s conditions.\n\n\n<b><b>Deepening repression around electoral disputes</b></b>\n\nInternet freedom plummeted by 14 points in Myanmar—the largest decline ever recorded in Freedom on the Net—after the military refused to accept the results of the November 2020 general elections and launched a deadly coup in February 2021. Internet connectivity was cut off every night from then until April, and mobile services were suspended entirely beginning in March, leaving only fixed-line and wireless broadband services available to users during the day. After opposition to the coup gathered force online and overflowed into the streets, the junta also blocked social media, stripped the licenses of independent online news outlets, forced service providers to hand over personal data, and seized control of the telecommunications infrastructure. Protesters and ordinary users alike suffered physical assaults and enforced disappearances in retaliation for their online activities.\n\n\nIn Belarus, another electoral dispute led to a seven-point decline in internet freedom. After authoritarian incumbent Alyaksandr Lukashenka claimed victory in a fraudulent presidential election in August 2020, citizens responded with peaceful protests, and security forces embarked on a violent crackdown to quell the demonstrations. The government repeatedly restricted access to the internet, detained and used deadly force against online activists, and ramped up social media surveillance. This repressive campaign continued into 2021, as authorities closed the offices and blocked the websites of TUT.by and Nasha Niva, two of the largest independent media outlets in the country. In May 2021, the Lukashenka regime forced a commercial plane to land in Minsk so it could arrest Raman Pratasevich, the former editor in chief of the popular NEXTA channel on the Telegram messaging platform.\n\n\nInternet freedom in Uganda fell by seven points after general elections in January 2021 that were marred by irregularities. Throughout the electoral period, a network of progovernment social media accounts flooded the online environment with manipulated information, while online journalists covering the campaign of opposition candidate Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as Bobi Wine, faced harassment and physical violence. Days before polls opened, President Yoweri Museveni’s government shut off the internet and blocked access to major social media platforms and circumvention tools. Facebook remained partially inaccessible for local users into the summer.\n\n\n<b><b>Promising breakthroughs</b></b>\n\nEcuador registered a five-point improvement this year, in part because there was no repetition of the intentional restrictions on internet connectivity that were imposed during mass protests against austerity measures in October 2019. The country’s information space increasingly featured more diverse content, thanks largely to the efforts of citizen journalists and Indigenous netizens. Long-standing threats to internet freedom persisted, however. State actors employed dubious copyright complaints to remove critical content, and at least one journalist was briefly detained in relation to a Facebook post.\n\n\nThe Gambia continued an upward trend in internet freedom that began with President Adama Barrow’s rise to office in 2017. The communications regulator fined a state-linked mobile service provider for unfairly manipulating voice termination rates, in a sign that the historically ineffective agency may be exercising its authority more fairly and independently. This year also featured fewer cyberattacks and instances of offline retribution for people’s online activities, both of which were reported frequently during the repressive regime of former president Yahya Jammeh.\n\n\nFor the third year in a row, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/iceland/freedom-net/2021\">Iceland</a> was ranked as the best environment for internet freedom, followed by <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/estonia/freedom-net/2021\">Estonia</a>. Residents of both countries enjoy high rates of access, few restrictions on content, and robust protections for human rights online. Costa Rica, one of the first countries to recognize internet access as a fundamental right, took third place. Its legal framework includes strong guarantees for free expression and safeguards against abusive surveillance.\n\n\nTaiwan enters Freedom on the Netwith a fifth-place ranking. The country boasts a vibrant online landscape supported by meaningful and affordable internet access, an independent judiciary that protects free expression, and a lack of website blocks. Taiwanese authorities have responded to adverse Chinese government influence with innovative regulations and democratic oversight of digital technology. However, users still contend with disinformation campaigns and debilitating cyberattacks, and some individuals have faced criminal prosecutions and fines for their online speech.\n\n\n<b><b>A fraught environment in the United States</b></b>\n\nInternet freedom declined in the United States for the fifth consecutive year. The spread of false and conspiracist content about the November 2020 elections shook the foundations of the American political system, culminating in outgoing president Donald Trump’s incitement of a violent mob to halt the certification of the election results on January 6, 2021. Several platforms took the dramatic step of deactivating Trump’s accounts over the incident, which sparked renewed debate about the power of companies to police politicians’ speech, as well as their responsibility to help prevent offline violence.\n\n\nA raft of new proposed laws, policies, and appointments in 2021 signaled a potential shift in approach by the administration of President Joseph Biden. An executive order issued in June 2021 rescinded President Trump’s August 2020 decision to halt transactions between US individuals and entities and the Chinese-owned social media applications TikTok and WeChat—an order that a federal judge had already suspended due to First Amendment concerns. Further action against Chinese companies may be on the horizon, however, as Biden asked the Department of Commerce to investigate whether mobile apps owned by foreign adversaries presented risks to US national security and users’ data privacy. In a positive move to address the country’s persistent gaps in access, legislators increased funding for broadband connectivity and other internet services in a December 2020 COVID-19 relief package and in a proposed infrastructure bill in 2021.\n\n\n<b><b>China’s ongoing digital authoritarianism</b></b>\n\nThe Chinese government remained the world’s worst abuser of internet freedom.New legislation criminalized expression that insults members of the armed forces, “heroes,” and “martyrs.” Authorities imposed draconian prison terms for online dissent, including an 18-year sentence against real-estate mogul Ren Zhiqiang, whose essay criticizingCommunist Party chief Xi Jinping’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic had circulated widely online. Ordinary users also continued to face legal repercussions for mundane daily activities like sharing news stories, talking about their religious beliefs, or communicating with family members overseas. Content related to COVID-19 remained one of the most censored topics in 2021. State media outlets, official social media accounts, and other actors with suspected government affiliations flooded the information space with false claims about the danger of US vaccines and the geographical origin of the virus. The internet regulator introduced new rules to restrict independently operated social media accounts that publish about current affairs, leading to the removal of many accounts.\n\n\nNevertheless, some courageous users continued to test the boundaries of the state’s internet controls. Clubhouse, a new app for real-time audio discussions, provided an unprecedented space for users to discuss sensitive issues with people outside of mainland China, until it was blocked in February 2021. A final post on the Weibo app by COVID-19 whistleblower Dr. Li Wenliang has served as a place for frustrated citizens to express themselves since his death in February 2020. And women’s rights supporters pushed back against misogynistic cyberbullying and censorship by tech companies.\n\n              <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Graphic_Social_Media_Arrests_09172021_UPDATED_FINAL.png\"><img /></a>\n\n                <b><b>Free expression in danger</b></b>\n\nFree expression is under unprecedented strain around the world. In 56 countries, a record 80 percent of those covered by Freedom on the Net,people were arrested or convicted for their online speech. Several governments this year also imposed especially egregious sentences. In December 2020, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/iran/freedom-net/2021\">Iranian</a> authorities executed Ruhollah Zam, who administered the popular Amad News channel on Telegram, after he was accused of inciting protests and being affiliated with foreign intelligence services. In January 2021, a court in <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/thailand/freedom-net/2021\">Thailand</a> sentenced a former civil servant to 43 years in prison after she was found guilty of violating the country’s draconian lèse-majesté law through her social media posts criticizing the monarchy. And in June 2021, an <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/egypt/freedom-net/2021\">Egyptian</a> court sentenced online influencers Haneen Hossam and Mawada al-Adham to 6 and 10 years in prison, respectively, for supposedly violating a human trafficking law by sharing TikTok videos that encouraged women to pursue careers on social media platforms.\n\n\nThis year, users faced physical attacks in retribution for their online activities in 41 countries, another record high for Freedom on the Net. Members of the student wing of <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/bangladesh/freedom-net/2021\">Bangladesh’s</a> ruling party violently assaulted a Dhaka University law student in August 2020, leaving him hospitalized in critical condition, in reprisal for alleged “antigovernment activities” on social media. Local police in <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/azerbaijan/freedom-net/2021\">Azerbaijan</a> visited a user’s home in January 2021 and lured him outside by claiming to represent a municipal employment center. He was then beaten, detained, and forced to apologize for Facebook posts in which he criticized local government officials.In <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/mexico/freedom-net/2021\">Mexico</a>, Pablo Morrugares Parraguirre, founder and editor of the news site PM Noticias, was killed by unidentified gunmen in August 2020 after he stated in a Facebook video that a local gang was responsible for a taxi driver’s murder.\n\n\nAt least 20 countries’ governments shut off the internet this year, and 21 states blocked social media and communication platforms, most often during times of political turmoil such as protests and elections. In <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/india/freedom-net/2021\">India</a>, internet access was cut off repeatedly throughout January and February 2021 as farmers took to the streets to express their opposition to agricultural reform bills. One shutdown in Delhi affected more than 50 million mobile subscribers. The Indian government also ordered the blocking of hundreds of mobile apps owned by China-based companies amid military clashes along the Indian-Chinese border, illustrating how geopolitical tensions can erode free expression and access to information. In <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/ethiopia/freedom-net/2021\">Ethiopia</a>, authorities shut off the internet nationwide for at least 15 days in July 2020 following the assassination of popular ethnic Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa and associated protests. The Ethiopian government also restricted connectivity in the Tigray Region in November 2020 as a conflict erupted between the federal government and Tigrayan forces. The shutdown continued during 2021, narrowing the flow of information in and out of the conflict area and limiting investigations into alleged atrocities perpetrated by government forces and their allies.\n\n\n<b><b>Spyware continues to proliferate</b></b>\n\nA booming commercial market for surveillance technology has given governments more capacity than ever before to flout the rule of law and monitor private communications at their discretion. Authorities in at least 45 of the 70 countries covered by Freedom on the Netare suspected of having access to sophisticated spyware or data-extraction technology supplied by secretive companies like NSO Group, Cellebrite, Circles, and FinFisher.\n\n\nLimited regulation of the sale and purchase of these tools, coupled with their near ubiquity and low cost in practice, has created a crisis for human rights. Citizen Lab and Amnesty International uncovered two separate spyware campaigns targeting Indian activist Anand Teltumbde. He was subsequently arrested in April 2020, with the case reportedly relying heavily on information pulled from his electronic devices. In July 2021, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/morocco/freedom-net/2021\">Moroccan</a> journalist Omar Radi, who had been repeatedly targeted with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware in recent years, was sentenced to six years in prison for sexual assault charges that rights groups including Freedom House have criticized as politically motivated. And an onslaught of misogynistic harassment directed at <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/lebanon/freedom-net/2021\">Lebanese</a> journalist Ghada Oueiss included a personal photo that was apparently stolen from her phone using spyware.\n\n\nThe ongoing criminal case against French surveillance companies Amesys and Nexa Technologies shows that some form of accountability is possible for the abuses emanating from the private surveillance market. In June 2021, four executives from the companies were indicted for complicity in torture and enforced disappearances after spyware sold to Libyan and Egyptian authorities was used to identify and track down perceived political opponents.\n\n              <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Graphic_Spyware_09172021_UPDATED_FINAL_.png\"><img /></a>\n\n                <b><b>The long haul of COVID-19</b></b>\n\nThroughout the coverage period, governments continued to cite the COVID-19 pandemic to justify the suppression of critical speech and the censorship of unfavorable news. In March 2021, the <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/cambodia/freedom-net/2021\">Cambodian</a> government criminalized “intentionally obstructing” the implementation of COVID-19 measures, with penalties of up to five years in prison and steep fines. Subsequently, several individuals, including a member of the country’s banned opposition party, were arrested for social media posts that criticized a vaccine created by a Chinese state-owned company. In July 2020, security officials in <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/kyrgyzstan/freedom-net/2021\">Kyrgyzstan</a> interrogated a Facebook user for allegedly inciting hatred through his criticism of the government’s COVID-19 strategy and then president Sooronbay Jeenbekov.\n\n\nSmartphone apps for contact tracing, vaccine management, and quarantine compliance also continued to be deployed with few safeguards against abuse, and revelations from the coverage period clarified the ease with which public health data could be accessed for other purposes. In January 2021, the <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/singapore/freedom-net/2021\">Singaporean</a> government confirmed that data collected from the country’s TraceTogether app were obtained by law enforcement bodies, spurring a public outcry that led to legal changes granting access to the data only for investigations of certain crimes. <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/australia/freedom-net/2021\">Australia’s</a> Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security reported in November 2020 that intelligence agencies had incidentally collected data from the country’s COVIDSafe app.\n\n\nIn a welcome development, a small number of governments rolled back problematic pandemic-related states of emergency that had unduly restricted free expression, while others ended overly broad data-sharing programs. In June 2020, an <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/argentina/freedom-net/2021\">Argentine</a> municipal government repealed an ordinance that fined users for sharing false information about COVID-19 after the law was enforced against journalists. Upon renewing its COVID-19 emergency powers in September 2020, the government of the Philippines omitted previous provisions that had criminalized online speech. And <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/armenia/freedom-net/2021\">Armenia’s</a> government ceased its collection of metadata, including location and phone-record data, from telecommunications companies for ostensible contact-tracing purposes; the hardware devices that stored the information were then physically destroyed.\n\n              \n  <img />\n      \n            <b>Key Internet Controls</b>\n    \n        To track the different ways in which governments seek to dominate the digital sphere, Freedom House monitors their application of nine Key Internet Controls. The resulting data reveal trends in the expansion and diversification of these constraints on internet freedom.\n        \n  <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//report/freedom-net/2021/key-internet-controls\">Learn More</a>\n\n\n\n                <b>The Promise and Peril of State Regulation</b>\n\nGlobal norms have shifted toward greater state intervention in the digital market. At least 48 countries pursued legislative or administrative action aimed at regulating technology companies over the past year. This trend comes amid calls to address societal problems that are exacerbated online, such as harassment, extremism, and serious criminality, and to better protect users from fraudsters, foreign adversaries, and exploitative business practices. While a few measures introduced this year have the potential to hold tech giants more accountable for their performance, most simply impose state and even political responsibilities on private firms without securing greater rights for users.\n\n\nThe impact of new laws and regulations on human rights varies from country to country. In robust democracies, well-crafted requirements for platforms have the potential to mitigate online harms while bolstering transparency and accountability. Analogous laws, however, may be abused by illiberal politicians and authoritarians to remove nonviolent political, social, and religious expression. Most alarming are those that bring the private sector further under the authority of the state in a bid to more effectively stamp out dissent, conduct blanket surveillance, and disseminate propaganda. In China, for example, local tech firms are punished not only for lax data security and monopolistic practices, but also for failing to remove cartoons that mock Xi Jinping and testimony from Uyghurs about arbitrary detentions in Xinjiang.\n\n\nIt is undeniable that the unregulated growth of the tech industry has given a small number of firms an astounding ability to monitor and influence the behavior of billions of people. On January 6, 2021, this power was in full view as Facebook, Twitter, and several other platforms took the dramatic decision to deactivate the accounts of outgoing US president Donald Trump. The president’s rhetoric had plainly contributed to the violent insurrection at the US Capitol, leading many to welcome the bans and suspensions in Trump’s case. The tech companies, however, were not clear or consistent about how they treated speech by influential politicians. In fact, they had long been dogged by accusations of arbitrary takedowns in other contexts, affecting journalists, human rights defenders, and members of marginalized communities around the world. Such incidents have strengthened the argument that major platforms cannot be relied upon to moderate content without some sort of oversight.\n\n\nYet as companies respond to public criticism by stepping up enforcement of their own community standards against false and violent rhetoric, they face increasingly tense showdowns with illiberal and authoritarian governments. Where democratic checks and balances are lacking, government officials will exploit regulation to punish any company that moderates politicians’ speech, or pushes back against arbitrary orders to remove content or hand over data. This year, officials in <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/india/freedom-net/2021\">India</a> pressured Twitter to remove protest-related and critical commentary and to stop flagging manipulated content shared by the ruling party. <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/nigeria/freedom-net/2021\">Nigerian</a> authorities blocked Twitter after the company removed incendiary posts by the country’s president. <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/turkey/freedom-net/2021\">Turkish</a> president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who himself has overseen the mass incarceration of journalists and opposition politicians, repeatedly accused tech companies of “digital fascism” for their refusal to comply with flawed provisions in the country’s new social media law. As an alternative to US firms, Erdoğan has promoted a state-owned messaging platform, while both Indian and Nigerian officials have migrated to Koo, a Bangalore-based app.\n\n\nA vibrant democracy requires laws and institutions that guard against the accumulation of powerin the hands of a few, whether in government or the private sector. The current drive for greater regulation raises the risk that instead of curbing and decentralizing the power of tech companies, governments will attempt to wield it for their own purposes and furtherinfringe on users’ rights. The most promising legislation seeks to address online ills while bringing both corporate and state practices into compliance with international human rights principles such as necessity, transparency, oversight, and due process. But the danger posed by the worst initiatives is immense: if placed in the hands of the state, the ability to censor, surveil, and manipulate people en masse can facilitate large-scale political corruption, subversion of the democratic process, and repression of political opponents and marginalized populations.\n\n              <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Graphic_Regulation_Types_UPDATED_FINAL_0.png\"><img /></a>\n\n                <b><b>New laws put free expression online at risk</b></b>\n\nAuthorities in at least 24 countries passed or announced new laws or rules governing how platforms treat content. They variously include requirements to take down illegal content, penalties for certain forms of removals, the appointment of legal representatives to manage state requests, and stronger transparency and due process provisions. The most problematic measures may result in increased censorship of political dissent, investigative reporting, and expressions of ethnic, religious, sexual, or gender identity, particularly among marginalized communities.\n\n\n<b>Problematic obligations to remove content</b>\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/india/freedom-net/2021\">India’s</a> new social media regulations represent one of the most comprehensive initiatives during this report’s coverage period. The updated Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules include new obligations for social media intermediaries, an expanded grievance mechanism through which users can complain directly to companies, and a reduced window for responding to law enforcement requests. Significant social media intermediaries—defined as companies with at least five million users—are required to deploy AI-based moderation tools, open in-country offices, and appoint three new local officers. A chief compliance officer, for example, must comply with takedown orders from a court, government agency, or any other competent authority within 36 hours, and can be held personally liable and face prison terms of up to seven years for failure to do so.\n\n\nThe Indian rules provide some improvements to platforms’ content moderation by requiring that significant social media intermediaries notify users when their content is removed, communicate a clear justification for the decision, and provide an avenue for appeal. However, the expanded obligations imposed on social media platforms, coupled with the in-country representative requirements and the risk of criminal liability, will curb companies’ willingness to push back against state censorship requests that do not meet international human rights standards. Indian law bans a broad array of vaguely defined content, including speech that undermines public order, decency, morality, or the country’s sovereignty, integrity, and security. The user reporting mechanisms could also be abused by the government’s partisan supporters to remove critical commentary.\n\n\nThe rules were announced amid worsening relations between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and Silicon Valley. During large protests against proposed agricultural reforms in February 2021, Twitter reversed its initial decision to fully comply with a government order to remove the accounts of journalists and activists. Over the following months, Twitter faced police inquiries and a visit to its offices, threats that its employees would be criminally charged, and claims by authorities that the platform had lost immunity from liability for user-generated content. Throughout the spring, the government ordered Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to remove content criticizing authorities’ handling of a deadly surge in COVID-19 infections.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/turkey/freedom-net/2021\">Turkey’s</a> new social media regulations came into effect in October 2020. Platforms with over a million daily users are required to remove content deemed “offensive” within 48 hours of being notified, or risk escalating penalties including fines, advertising bans, and limitations on bandwidth. The platforms are also required to appoint a Turkish national as an in-country representative or establish a local legal entity, which is then subject to judicial fines for failure to comply with legal orders to remove content. The law reduced social media companies’ ability to resist requests from Turkish authorities that are designed to further censor opposition voices, independent journalism, and nonviolent expression. Most companies have since established a legal entity, though some have promised that there will be no change to their content moderation policies.\n\n\nSimilarly, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/indonesia/freedom-net/2021\">Indonesia’s</a> Ministerial Regulation 5, enacted in November 2020, places new takedown and registration requirements on a broad array of tech companies regardless of their size, including social media apps, content-sharing services, and search engines. Once notified, a platform has only four hours in “urgent” situations or 24 hours otherwise to remove “prohibited” content, broadly conceptualized as speech that violates any domestic law, creates community anxiety, or disturbs public order. Authorities have already applied existing laws to censor LGBT+ content, criticism of Islam, and commentary about an independence movement in the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Those not in compliance with the new regulation risk a range of penalties that include blocking and revocation of licenses. In addition to human rights concerns regarding its expansive scope, the regulation’s tight removal deadlines raise the question of whether any but the largest companies have the resources to comply and thus survive in the Indonesian market. The deadlines also incentivize companies to deploy automated monitoring systems that often excessively or inconsistently flag and censor users’ speech.\n\n\nThe <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/russia/freedom-net/2021\">Russian</a> government added to the labyrinth of regulations that international tech companies must navigate in the country. A January 2021 law introduced new fines for websites and platforms that fail to remove content the state deems “illegal,” while a February law reinforced platforms’ obligations to identify and remove banned content and required them to coordinate with the federal regulator, Roskomnadzor, regarding content moderation decisions. The simmering tension between foreign platforms and the Russian state came to a boil in March, when Roskomnadzor throttled Twitter’s traffic over the company’s failure to comply in full with orders to remove information related to protests against the detention of opposition leader Aleksey Navalny.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/australia/freedom-net/2021\">Australia</a> and the <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-kingdom/freedom-net/2021\">United Kingdom</a> introduced legislation intended to address concerns about online safety. Australia’s Online Safety Act, adopted in June 2021, empowers an eSafety Commissioner to order companies to remove content—vaguely described as image-based abuse, cyber abuse, cyberbullying, or otherwise harmful material—within 24 hours. By requiring such rapid takedowns and including unclear definitions of prohibited content, the law risks disproportionately affecting the legitimate speech of marginalized groups, including sex workers and educators, LGBT+ communities, and artists. The law also lacks accountability for how the commissioner makes decisions, provides little opportunity for users to respond to complaints about their content, and encapsulates a variety of different internet companies instead of differentiating obligations based on their size and function. The United Kingdom’s Online Safety Bill, which had yet to pass at the time of writing, also places the duty of care on content providers to ensure that their users are not exposed to either illegal or harmful content, which are not clearly defined.\n\n\n<b>Misguided anticensorship laws</b>\n\nThe decision by several major platforms to deactivate the accounts of outgoing president Trump in January 2021 sparked numerous bad-faith attempts at regulation, particularly in countries where populist leaders have relied on the power of social media to dominate public discourse.\n\n\nWeeks after Trump was banned, the Russian parliament announced plans for a law that would impose fines on companies for blocking users illegally. President Vladimir Putin had already signed a law in December that allows authorities to block platforms for restricting content from Russian state news outlets. That law cited instances in which Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube had “censored” the state-affiliated outlets RT, RIA Novosti, and Crimea 24. Facebook and Twitter had previously introduced labels for state-affiliated media groups, identifying RT and RIA Novosti as being closely associated with or under the direct editorial control of the Russian government.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/mexico/freedom-net/2021\">Mexican</a> president Andrés Manuel López Obrador similarly lambasted social media companies as “global institutions of censorship” after the ban on Trump, suggesting the creation of a new state-owned service as an alternative.A few weeks later, Mexico’s Senate Majority Leader proposed draft legislation that grants the country’sregulator broad authority to overturn social media companies’ content moderation decisions without judicial oversight, including the power to order the restoration of users’ accounts or content if they were removed. In addition to prohibiting the removal of content not outlined in the bill, the legislation would require platforms to restrict content that the regulator deems to be hateful, false, or threatening to public order. Companies that fail to comply would face fines of up to $4.4 million.\n\n\nIn September 2021, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/brazil/freedom-net/2021\">Brazilian</a> president Jair Bolsonaro signed new rules that modify the country’s Marco Civil da Internet, one of the world’s most comprehensive laws protecting human rights online. Social media companies can now restrict users' accounts and content only under very narrow circumstances, for instance, if the material involves nudity or violence, or when acting on a court order. The president's decree effectively limits companies’ ability to enforce their own terms of service by curbing health misinformation or falsehoods that sow doubt about the electoral process—both of which Bolsonaro himself has actively disseminated.\n\n\n<b>A more promising focus on transparency and due process</b>\n\nThe European Union (EU) framework for internet regulation may offer a “third way” between China’s digital authoritarianism and the traditional US emphasis on unrestricted speech and free markets. Two pieces of EU legislation introduced this year—the Digital Services Act (DSA) and the Digital Markets Act—promise to set some positive rules for the tech sector, although democratic policymakers should remain wary of the negative repercussions that their laws could have on internet freedom in more closed environments. Germany’s 2018 Network Enforcement Act (NetzDG), for example, introduced problematic requirements for companies to expediently remove content without a court order and establish a local legal presence. While the law has since been amended, the original has been mimicked and misused by backsliding democracies and authoritarian regimes in order to force social media providers to remove LGBT+ content and investigative journalism. Similarly, authorities in several countries cited the EU’s 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to stymie cross-border data flows and support vague exemptions for state surveillance.\n\n\nThe DSA requires large intermediaries to produce detailed reports on a broad range of their practices, including content moderation, algorithmic curation and recommendation systems, and online advertising. Due process protections would also be bolstered under the law. Users would be notified about moderation decisions affecting their content and provided with an appeals process. However, the proposal builds on the controversial “notice-and-action” framework first introduced in the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) of 1998, which created a standard mechanism for copyright owners to request the removal of infringing materials from platforms without a court order. The DMCA suffers from challenges in issuing counternotices and documented abuse by politicians seeking to remove unfavorable content. Attention is needed to ensure that the DSA addresses these shortcomings and does not become a global model for censoring political expression.\n\n\nIn the <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-states/freedom-net/2021\">United States</a>, revisions to the draft Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency Act pushed the legislation in a positive direction following feedback from civil society. The bipartisan measure requires companies to publish details about their moderation practices, institute due process protections for users, and remove content deemed illegal by a court within four days. This bill largely avoids the missteps of many more problematic proposals to reform Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which has long shielded providers and content hosts from legal liability for most material created by users.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/taiwan/freedom-net/2021\">Taiwan’s</a> draft Internet Audiovisual Service Management Act would enhance transparency about streaming platforms’ operations in the country by mandating that certain companies report revenue and user statistics, provide an easy-to-use user complaint mechanism, and ensure that their terms of service clarify how data are collected and used, among other policies. The bill was introduced amid concerns that streaming platforms owned by China-based companies were operating illegally in Taiwan and could facilitate the spread of disinformation or other manipulated content emanating from Beijing.\n\n              <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Graphic_Bestworst_Reg_UPDATED_FINAL.png\"><img /></a>\n\n                <b><b>Forcing companies to hand over user data</b></b>\n\nIn at least 38 of the 70 countries assessed this year, governments initiated legal or administrative reforms affecting tech companies’ management of user data. Major platforms have often been prohibited by their home country’s laws from handing over data to foreign officials. The governments seeking information are now attempting to sidestep these jurisdictional barriers by forcing companies to store data on servers based within their borders, surrender personal data to law enforcement agencies with limited oversight, and circumvent the encryption of private communications. Particularly in countries with poor human rights records, domestic data storage significantly expands the potential for surveillance and the risk of abuse. These problematic provisions are sometimes paired with more positive requirements for companies to protect users’ data from other threats.\n\n\n<b>Data sovereignty as an excuse for surveillance</b>\n\nA draft decree released in February 2021, as part of the implementation of <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/vietnam/freedom-net/2021\">Vietnam’s</a> Cybersecurity Law, expands requirements for large and small online platforms to store data on Vietnamese servers, including users’ names, birth dates, nationality, identity cards, credit card numbers, biometric files, and health records. Authorities can access user data under vaguely defined pretexts related to national security and public order. Full compliance with Vietnamese law by social media companies would put activists, journalists, and human rights defenders at risk, given the one-party regime’s harsh suppression of perceived political dissent.\n\n\nInterim regulations published in <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/saudi-arabia/freedom-net/2021\">Saudi Arabia</a> in October 2020 aim “to ensure preservation of the digital national sovereignty over data.” Companies and government entities must obtain written approval from the government regulator before processing or transferring personal data outside of the country. Meanwhile, new data protection regulations enacted in Dubai, in the <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/united-arab-emirates/freedom-net/2021\">United Arab Emirates</a>, require the local storage of any “secretive, sensitive, and confidential” data pertaining to individuals and companies. A new data protection bill proposed in October 2020 in Bangladesh would also require domestic data storage.\n\n\nIn some cases, such data localization requirements have been introduced in the context of content regulation. Pakistan’s proposed Removal and Blocking of Unlawful Online Content (Procedure, Oversight and Safeguards) Rules, the latest version of which was published in November 2020, outlines requirements for social media companies to establish one or more data servers in the country. Similarly, Turkey’s social media law requires platforms to store data locally and establish domestic legal representatives or face five stages of escalating penalties, including fines, an advertising ban, and bandwidth limitations of up to 90 percent.\n\n\nData protection policies may also be used to place stringent limitations on cross-border data transfers and impose onerous licensing requirements on companies. Under a data protection law ratified in <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/egypt/freedom-net/2021\">Egypt</a> in July 2020, domestic and foreign entities must obtain a state license and appoint a local data protection officer to conduct cross-border data transfers. Unlike the independent commissions formed in many democracies, Egypt’s data protection agency will be supervised by a board comprising representatives of government ministries, including security and intelligence officials. The law’s exorbitant licensing fees are prohibitive for many small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\n\n<b>Continuing pressure on encryption</b>\n\nIn addition to requiring data localization, many new regulations threaten to undermine encryption, which is essential for data privacy and cybersecurity and a critical tool for journalists and human rights defenders around the world. India’s revised Information Technology Rules require large social media platforms to identify and disclose the “first originator” of a message if requested by the government or judiciary in cases related to state sovereignty, security, public order, and sexually explicit content. Companies would effectively have to dismantle end-to-end encryption in order to unmask a message’s originator, undermining the privacy and security protections on which users, companies, and governments have come to rely. In May 2021, WhatsApp sued the government to halt the rules’ implementation, arguing that the traceability requirements violated constitutionally guaranteed privacy protections.\n\n\nThe proposed Brazilian Internet Freedom, Responsibility, and Transparency Act includes similar yet more narrow traceability requirements. Private messaging services would be required to store for three months the traceability data of messages that go viral, defined as those forwarded by more than five users and that reach at least 1,000 accounts. While this provision is significantly scaled back from one in an earlier draft, companies would still in practice have to erode encryption to trace and identify messages that reach the low virality threshold.\n\n\nPakistan’s proposed rules have raised alarms about their impact on end-to-end encryption. The draft requires social media companies and service providers with more than 500,000 users to hand over personal data in a decrypted and readable format when requested by the Federal Investigation Agency. Similarly, amendments to the Nigerian Broadcasting Code proposed in August 2020 require broadcasters to comply with decryption orders during moments of emergency.\n\n\nOver the past year, democratic leaders again disparaged end-to-end encryption, serving the interests of more authoritarian governments that seek to undermine the technology for their own political ends. For example, in October 2020 leaders from Japan, India, and the Five Eyes—an intelligence alliance composed of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—decried encryption as an impediment to national security, criminal, and child sexual abuse investigations. But any weakening of encryption protocols or requirements for “backdoor” access would effectively undermine the security of civil society groups, businesses, and ordinary users, potentially endangering lives.\n\n\n<b>Contrasting dynamics in China</b>\n\nIn China, growing public anger at a series of data scandals has put authorities under greater pressure to limit companies’ exploitation of user information. This year’s Personal Information Protection Law, which draws on the EU’s GDPR framework, is the country’s first comprehensive attempt at limiting how companies collect, store, and use personal data. A regulation introduced in March 2021 limited the types of data that apps can require from users. Regulators subsequently alleged that over 100 apps—including those from Chinese tech giants Tencent and Baidu—violated the rules. In July, authorities asserted that the ride-hailing app Didi illegally collected users’ personal information. Didi was pulled from China-based app stores, and a scheduled initial public offering on a US stock exchange was canceled. Authorities also passed a Data Security Law this year that requires Chinese companies to obtain approval from the state prior to sharing data with a foreign judicial or law enforcement entity.\n\n\nAt the same time, China is home to the world’s largest surveillance state. Under its Cybersecurity Law, implemented in 2017, companies must store users’ data on local servers and decrypt the data on request from the authorities. Vague laws enable state agencies to monitor the population for an expansive list of activities and ideas that are deemed harmful by the one-party regime. In practice, this includes political, social, and religious expression, independent reporting, and the online activities of marginalized groups, for which users can face draconian criminal penalties.\n\n\n<b>Protecting users’ data</b>\n\nSome new data protection laws introduced during the coverage period established meaningful constraints and oversight on how private companies access, store, and use personal information, without further empowering the state to monitor its citizens. In Ecuador, nearly two years after a sprawling data breach revealed over 20 million people’s information, the government adopted a new data protection law in May 2021. The law, one of the most robust of its kind in Latin America, creates a new data protection agency, regulates cross-border transfers, and requires companies to provide users with the ability to access, amend, or delete their information. Although it strongly resembles the GDPR, the Ecuadorean law prescribes significantly lower fines for noncompliance compared with the EU regulation.\n\n\nSeveral governments over the past year also investigated or fined companies for their misuse of data. In December 2020, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/france/freedom-net/2021\">France’s</a> data protection agency fined Google €100 million ($120 million) and Amazon €35 million ($41.9 million) for breaching the country’s French Data Protection Act. <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/italy/freedom-net/2021\">Italy’s</a> data protection authority fined the telecom provider Wind €17 million ($20.3 million) for unlawful data processing and the provider Iliad €800,000 ($958,000) for violating the GDPR in July 2020.\n\n\n<b><b>Fostering competitionto improve digital rights</b></b>\n\nIn at least 21 countries over the past year, authorities proposed action against companies to defend competition in the digital market. Governments around the world recognized that market forces, when left unchecked, pose a threat to users’ rights. Regulators are employing competition policy as a tool to prevent abuse of user data, strengthen the information space, and empower users with greater choice. Like anticorruption campaigns, however, competition policy may also be wielded in a politically motivated manner. As more governments build their capacity to regulate digital markets, it is vital that they adhere to good governance and human rights principles regarding necessity, proportionality, and transparency in order to ensure that both state and corporate power remain accountable to the public.\n\n\n<b>Democracies ramp up scrutiny of business practices</b>\n\nThe proposed Digital Markets Act, unveiled by the EU in December 2020, is a sweeping effort to set clear, consistent, and rights-respecting rules. The draft legislation reclassifies certain service providers as “gatekeepers.” Such companies are prohibited from ranking their own products ahead of competitors and preinstalling their own apps on devices. The bill also provides users with the ability to transfer their data across services, a feature known as data portability.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/germany/freedom-net/2021\">Germany</a> passed similar provisions in a January 2021 Digitalization Act that grants the Federal Cartel Office (FCO) greater authority to investigate companies’ behavior, with a specific mandate to ascertain whether they are denying interoperability, preinstalling apps, preventing competitors from advertising, or failing to provide users with agency to determine and understand how their data are processed. After the passage of the law, the FCO launched investigations into market behavior by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google. The UK Competition and Markets Authority announced in June that it would play an active role in shaping Google’s new Privacy Sandbox feature to ensure that replacements for cookie tracking, meant to protect privacy, do not harm competition.\n\n\nAntimonopoly action also intensified in the United States. Under new chairperson Lina Khan, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has pursued more vigorous rulemaking and lowered the threshold for staff to launch investigations and sue companies. The Biden administration issued an executive order in July that empowered the FTC and the Department of Justice to more stringently enforce existing antitrust laws, challenge previous mergers, and create new rules addressing companies’ accumulation of Americans’ data. Separately, Google and Apple faced lawsuits over their app store fees, and a bundle of antitrust bills that could fundamentally reshape the US tech sector were introduced in Congress this year.\n\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/south-korea/freedom-net/2021\">South Korea’s</a> Fair Trade Commission has been active over the past year. In August 2020, Apple paid $84 million to settle an antitrust case after an investigation found that the company had abused its position of dominance by burdening local businesses with iPhone-related costs. In April 2021, the commission raided Facebook’s local offices as part of a probe into whether the company forces app developers to advertise solely on its platform. And in June 2021, a new division was set up to investigate whether major companies like Facebook and Google have engaged in unfair practices, including the deceptive collection of personal data, to fuel online advertising.\n\n\nIn May 2021, <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/argentina/freedom-net/2021\">Argentina's</a> National Commission for the Defense of Competition ordered Facebook’s WhatsApp platform to suspend the implementation of its new privacy policy for at least 180 days. The measure was part of an effort to ensure that the company does not “abuse its dominant market position,” as the new policy would give Facebook access to users’ data “at a level other companies cannot replicate.” Similar investigations into WhatsApp’s privacy policy changes are underway in India.\n\n\n<b>Compelling platforms to share revenue with publishers</b>\n\nRegulators in several countries sought to pressure tech companies into negotiations with news publishers on the sharing of profits from advertising revenue. Google agreed in early 2021 to seek revenue-sharing agreements with French publishers in compliance with a new copyright law, but France’s antitrust agency imposed a €500 million ($600 million) fine in July on the grounds that the tech giant was not negotiating in good faith. In May 2021, Facebook agreed to share revenue with 14 Canadian publishers.\n\n\nIn <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/country/australia/freedom-net/2021\">Australia</a>, a News Media Bargaining Code that was adopted in February 2021 raised tensions among major publishers, tech companies, and the government. The rules came about after the country’s competition watchdog found that technology companies were not treating domestic media organizations fairly. The code establishes an arbitration regime requiring designated platforms to negotiate and pay a narrowly defined set of news outlets when their content is used. While competition policy can play a role in ensuring media diversity and sustainability, the Australian measure privileges legacy media institutions at the expense of newer, smaller, and more local outlets, and it does not stipulate that the beneficiaries must use the new revenue for journalistic purposes. The code also obliges platforms to share user data with media organizations, further embedding the news industry in the problematic targeted-advertising industry.\n\n\nIn response to the flawed legislation, Facebook took the extraordinary decision to block all news content for users based in Australia for one week. The move restricted access to community groups, health information, and other essential services in the process. Eventually, Facebook lifted the ban after the government made amendments to the code designed to extend revenue-sharing negotiations.\n\n\n<b>Competition policy as a tool for regime empowerment</b>\n\nIn authoritarian states and other countries that lack effective due process guarantees, competition enforcement carries a stronger risk of abuse. Although monopolistic corporations and unfair market practices are just as corrosive to users’ rights in such countries as they are in democracies, several cases demonstrate the potential for competition policy to be enforced in an arbitrary or opaque manner that compels companies and prominent businesspeople to serve the leadership’s political interests, granting the government greater control over the information space and access to sensitive data. For example, in April 2021, Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service opened an investigation into allegations that Google was “abusing its dominant market position in video hosting services” at a time when the government was also demanding that YouTube, a Google subsidiary, remove content posted by opposition activists.\n\n\nChinese authorities have been among the most aggressive in addressing monopolistic practices and market abuses, though their interventions have raised concerns that the government is more interested in reining in these companies’ autonomy and influence over the economy, public debate, and information space than in protecting the rights of citizens. New competition rules issued in February 2021 signaled the regime’s unease with the rapid growth and consolidation of the country’s tech sector. The regulations primarily target Alibaba and Tencent, with a specific focus on their respective financial services Alipay and WeChat Pay. The measures ban price fixing, predatory pricing, and the use of algorithms to manipulate the market. Two months later in April 2021, regulators slapped a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba for using its algorithms and unfair access to data to further entrench its market position. Ant Group, an Alibaba affiliate and the parent company of Alipay, was also ordered to restructure into a financial holding company, putting it under stricter banking regulations. Alibaba was reportedly ordered to divest its media holdings, including stakes in the social media platform Weibo, due to the ruling Communist Party’s concern that the company’s influence over public opinion could rival its own.\n\n\nThe crackdown featured prominent signs of political motivation and direct pressure on business leaders. Alibaba founder Jack Ma had disappeared from public view for almost three months after contradicting senior government officials and criticizing regulators at an October 2020 conference. That November, a scheduled initial public offering for Ant Group was canceled, and an investigation into Alibaba’s “monopolistic practices” was announced in December. Ma resurfaced in an online video ceremony in which he recited regime talking points about public welfare and rural revitalization.\n\n\nPolicies that ensure competition and limit concentrations of power among tech companies are crucial for ensuring a healthy democracy, but authoritarian states will continue to use such policies as a tool to reinforce their own unchecked authority.\n\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/FINAL_FOTN_2021_Cover_Illustration.jpg\">Cover illustration</a> by Mitch Blunt\n\n              \n  <b>Internet Freedom Score - Largest Declines</b>\n\n  <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//country/myanmar/freedom-net/2021\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Myanmar</b></a>\n            \n            Myanmar saw a <b>14 point decline</b> in its internet freedom score, the largest decline ever recorded in Freedom on the Net.\n          <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//country/belarus/freedom-net/2021\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Belarus</b></a>\n            \n            Belarus saw a <b>7 point decline</b> in its internet freedom score.\n          <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//country/uganda/freedom-net/2021\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Uganda</b></a>\n            \n            Uganda saw a <b>7 point decline</b> in its internet freedom score.\n\n\n              \n  <b>Report Materials</b>\n\n  <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Complete_Booklet_09162021_FINAL_UPDATED.pdf\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Report PDF</b></a>\n            \n            Download the complete Freedom on the Net 2021 <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Complete_Booklet_09162021_FINAL_UPDATED.pdf\">PDF booklet</a> or the <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-11/FOTN_2021_Abridged_Final_11042021.pdf\">abridged version here</a>.\n          <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//explore-the-map?type=fotn&year=2021\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Report Map</b></a>\n            \n            Explore internet freedom around the world through the Freedom on the Net 2021 <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//explore-the-map?type=fotn&year=2021\">interactive map</a>or <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Map_09152021_UPDATED_FINAL.jpg\">view the static image file</a>.\n          <img />\n      \n                  <b>Report Data</b>\n  \n            \n            <ul><li><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Country_Score_Data.xlsx\"><b>2021 Country Score Data (.xlsx)</b></a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Key_Internet_Controls.xlsx\"><b>2021 Key Internet Controls Data (.xlsx)</b></a></li>\n\t<li><a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/2021-09/FOTN_2021_Data_Essays_and_Graphics_FINAL.xlsx\"><b>2021 Data Essays and Graphics Data (.xlsx)</b></a></li></ul>\n          <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//report/freedom-net/2021/global-drive-control-big-tech/acknowledgments\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Acknowledgements</b></a>\n            \n            Freedom on the Net is a collaborative effort between Freedom House staff and a network of more than 80 researchers covering 70 countries.\n          <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//reports/freedom-net/freedom-net-research-methodology\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Research Methodology</b></a>\n            \n            The Freedom on the Net index measures each country’s level of internet freedom based on a set of 21 questions.\n          <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//countries/freedom-net/scores\"><img />\n      \n                  <b>Country Narratives</b></a>\n            \n            Visit our Countries in Detail page to view all Freedom on the Net 2021scores and read individual country narratives.\n\n\n              \n  <img />\n      \n            <b>About Freedom on the Net</b>\n    \n        <a href=\"https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net\">Freedom on the Net</a> is Freedom House’s annual survey and analysis of internet freedom around the world. This cutting-edge project consists of ground-breaking research and analysis, fact-based advocacy, and on-the-ground capacity building.\n        \n  <a href=\"freedomhouse.org//report/freedom-net\">Learn More</a>"
