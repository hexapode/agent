The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an\nadequate remedy for any such breach. In the event any party hereto brings any action, claim, complaint, suit, action or other proceeding to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to the Closing, the\nTermination Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time during which such action, claim, complaint, suit, action or other proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii) such other time period\nestablished by the court presiding over such action, claim, complaint, suit, action or other proceeding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the Financing Sources shall have any liability to the Company or any person\nthat is an affiliate of the Company relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Commitment Letter, whether at law, or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, and neither the Company nor any person that is an affiliate of the Company shall\nhave any rights or claims against any Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder. As used in this Agreement, the term �Financing Sources� means any agent, arranger, Lender or other entity that has committed to provide or arrange, or\nhas entered into definitive agreements related to, any debt financing related to the Merger, or any of such person�s affiliates or its or their respective officers, directors, employees, partners, trustees, shareholders, controlling persons,\nagents, representatives, successors or assigns. ",
    "result": "This extract from the agreement is mainly about the enforcement of the terms and provisions of the agreement. It states that the parties are entitled to seek injunctions to prevent breaches of the agreement and to enforce specific terms. It also specifies that the parties agree not to argue that specific enforcement is unenforceable or that monetary damages would be an adequate remedy for any breach. Furthermore, it includes a provision regarding the extension of the termination date in the event of an action to enforce the agreement. Lastly, it clarifies that the financing sources have no liability to the company and that the company has no rights or claims against the financing sources.\n\nBased on this information, the type of clause is: Enforcement"
