are the best car insurance companies overall, with 5 stars in our ratings. USAA auto insurance is available only to military members, veterans and their immediate family members.\n\nThe best car insurance companies for you will depend on your driving record, state and other individual factors. Shopping around to <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/car-insurance-quotes/')\">compare car insurance quotes</a> will reveal the companies that can give you the best price for your situation.\n\n<b>Best for Low Car Insurance Rates: Geico</b>\n<a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/geico-car-insurance-review/')\">Geico</a> comes in with the lowest rates nationwide that are available to the general public when we look at average rates across a variety of driving records and driver ages. (USAA is cheaper but membership is limited to car owners with a military connection.)\n\nDrivers who have poor credit should compare quotes from Geico because of its competitive rates. Getting quotes is worthwhile if you have poor credit because many auto insurance companies charge much higher rates based solely on poor credit\n\n<b>Best for Low Complaints: American Family and Travelers</b>\nComplaints against a company are a reflection of customer service. Most complaints about car insurance companies revolve around problems with claims. <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/american-family-car-insurance-review/')\">American Family</a> and <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/travelers-car-insurance-review/')\">Travelers</a>have very low levels of auto insurance complaints, based on verified complaints made to state insurance departments around the country.\n\n<b>Best for Collision Repair: Erie</b>\n<a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/erie-car-insurance-review/')\">Erie</a> receives the highest grade from collision repair professionals among the companies we analyzed, with a B+. Collision repair professionals get an inside look at which insurers try to cut corners and which ones have the smoothest claims processes.\n\n<b>Best for Drivers With a Speeding Ticket: Geico and Westfield</b>\nDrivers who have gotten a speeding ticket can expect it to affect rates for three to five years, depending on your insurance company and state. Geico and Westfield have the lowest rates for these drivers, among companies open to the general public. Westfield is a regional insurer that sells auto insurance in 10 states, mainly in the Midwest.\n\nUSAA also has low rates for military members and veterans who have speeding tickets on their records.\n\n<b>Best for Drivers Who Caused an Accident: Auto-Owners</b>\nA “chargeable” accident can stay on your record and affect your car insurance rates for three to five years, depending on your state laws and/or car insurance company. <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/auto-owners-car-insurance-review/')\">Auto-Owners</a> has the best average rates for drivers stuck in this spot, based on the companies we analyzed.\n\nThe severity of the accident, meaning the dollar cost of property damage and/or injuries, can affect the amount of your surcharge. Ask your auto insurance agent how long the surcharge will affect your car insurance rates.\n\n<b>Best for Drivers With a DUI: Progressive</b>\nYou can’t avoid higher rates after a <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/legal/dui/dui-laws/')\">DUI</a>, but <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/progressive-car-insurance-review/')\">Progressive</a> offers the most competitive pricing for drivers in this situation, based on nationwide averages among the companies we analyzed.\n\nCar insurance companies will usually pull your motor vehicle report when you’re getting a new quote or when your policy is coming up for renewal. This is their chance to adjust rates based on your recent history of problems, and a DUI conviction will be a costly insurance problem.\n\n<b>Best for Military Members: USAA</b>\nWith its consistently good rates and variety of coverage options, <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/usaa-car-insurance-review/')\">USAA</a> remains the best car insurance option for military members year after year. While the level of complaints about USAA auto insurance has been rising over the past couple of years, its current complaint level is about average for the industry.\n                        <b>Car

If an uninsured motorist crashes into you, this coverage will pay you and your passengers’ medical bills. Although in states with a “no-fault” car insurance system, you’ll use your own <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/pip-guide/')\">personal injury protection (PIP)</a> for the medical expenses of you and your passengers, no matter who was to blame for the accident.\n\n<a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/comprehensive-vs-collision-auto-insurance/')\">Collision and comprehensive insurance</a> are likely required for your car loan if you financed your vehicles. Even if you don’t have a car loan it’s smart to have these types of car insurance, especially on newer vehicles.  Collision insurance covers car accidents with other vehicles or objects, such as a building or pole, and pays regardless of fault. Comprehensive auto insurance covers car theft, fires, damage from severe weather, floods, hail, falling objects, vandalism and striking an animal.\n                        <b>Methodology</b>                To identify the best car insurance companies we evaluated each company based on its average rates for a variety of drivers, the coverage options offered, complaints against the company and collision repair grades from auto body professionals.\n\n<b>Auto insurance rates (50% of score):</b> We used data from <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.quadinfo.com/')\">Quadrant Information Services</a> to find average rates from each company for good drivers, drivers who have caused an accident, drivers with a speeding ticket, drivers with a DUI, drivers with poor credit, drivers caught without insurance, adding a teen driver, senior drivers and young drivers.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, rates are based on a 40-year-old female driver with a Toyota RAV4 and coverage of:\n\n<ul><li>$100,000 for injuries to one person, $300,000 for injuries per accident and $100,000 for property damage (known as 100/300/100).</li>\n<li>Uninsured motorist coverage of 100/300.</li>\n<li>Collision and comprehensive insurance with a $500 deductible.</li></ul>\n<b>Car insurance coverage options (25% of score):</b> Any auto insurance company can provide the basics of liability insurance, collision and comprehensive coverage and other standard offerings. But it’s also important to have access to additional coverage types that can provide greater protection or cost savings. In this category, we gave points to companies that offer accident forgiveness, new car replacement, vanishing deductibles, usage-based or pay-per-mile insurance and SR-22s.\n\n<b>Complaints (20% of score):</b> We used complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Each state’s department of insurance is in charge of logging and monitoring complaints against the companies that operate in their states. Most auto insurance complaints center on claims, including unsatisfactory settlements, delays and denials. The industry complaint average is 1.00, so companies with a ratio below 1.00 have lower levels of complaints.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Best_Car_Insurance_complaint__comparison.png\"/>\n\n<b>Collision repair (5% of score):</b> We incorporated grades of insurance companies from collision repair professionals.
