Read the clause carefully and identify the key terms and phrases.\n2. Break down the clause into smaller components to understand the relationships between the terms and phrases.\n3. Verify if the clause accurately defines the term \"ERISA Affiliate\" by including all necessary elements.\n4. Compare the definition with the relevant legal framework (Section 414 of the Code) to ensure consistency and compliance.\n5. Check for any ambiguity or confusion in the language used.\n6. Assess whether the clause is clear and understandable to readers who may not have specialized knowledge.\n\nBased on the analysis, if any issues are identified, we can suggest a new version of the clause. Otherwise, we can output the original text as the END_RESULT.\n\nPlease wait while I review the clause."
