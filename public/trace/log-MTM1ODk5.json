Here are the steps to review and potentially suggest edits to the clause:\n\n1. Break down the clause into smaller segments for analysis:\n   - A state or jurisdiction is specified.\n   - The clause is:\n     (b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or notice to, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made by or with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under applicable Law in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other than (i) the applicable reporting or other requirements of and filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act (including the filing of the Proxy Statement), (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State in accordance with the DGCL and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business, (iii) such filings as may be required in connection with the Taxes described in Section 8.6, (iv) such other items required solely by reason of the participation of the Company in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) compliance with and filings or notifications under the HSR Act, other Antitrust Laws (vi) compliance with and filings or notifications under any Foreign Investment Laws, and (vii) such other Consents, registrations, declarations, filings or notices the failure of which to be obtained or made would not have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.\n\n2. Analyze each smaller segment and determine if it is clear and well-structured.\n\nBased on the analysis, here is a revised version of the clause:\n\n(a) No Consent, registration, declaration, or filing with any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under applicable Law regarding the execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement or the completion of the contemplated transactions, except for the following:\n\n(i) Compliance with the applicable reporting and filing requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act (including the filing of the Proxy Statement).\n(ii) Filing the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State in accordance with the DGCL.\n(iii) Filing appropriate documents with the relevant authorities in the jurisdictions where Parent or any of its Subsidiaries are qualified to do business.\n(iv) Filing requirements related to Taxes as described in Section 8.6.\n(v) Compliance with filings or notifications under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws.\n(vi) Compliance with filings or notifications under any Foreign Investment Laws.\n(vii) Other Consents, registrations, declarations, filings, or notices that, if not obtained or made, would not have a material adverse effect on Parent.\n\nEND_RESULT The revised clause addresses the complexity and lengthy structure of the original version while maintaining clarity and precision."

Read and understand the clause: \"(iv) causing the Financing Sources to fund the Financing no later than the Closing (including by enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and/or Financing Agreements, as applicable).\"\n\nBased on the given information, the clause seems to be discussing the responsibility of the involved party to ensure that the Financing Sources provide the necessary funds for the financing before the Closing.\n\n2. Analyze the clause structure:\n- The clause is numbered as \"iv,\" suggesting it might be part of a larger document or agreement.\n- The main action in this clause is \"causing the Financing Sources to fund the Financing.\"\n- The timeline is indicated as \"no later than the Closing.\"\n- The clause mentions \"enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and/or Financing Agreements.\"\n\n3. Evaluate clarity and revision potential:\n- The clause structure seems clear and concise.\n- However, the phrase \"causing the Financing Sources to fund the Financing\" could be rewritten for better clarity and readability.\n- The mention of \"enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and/or Financing Agreements\" could be revised to provide more context and specificity.\n\nBased on the evaluation, the suggested revised version of the clause could be:\n\"The involved party shall ensure that the Financing Sources provide the necessary funding for the Financing by the Closing deadline, utilizing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and/or Financing Agreements, if required.\"\n\nAfter the END_RESULT keyword, output the revised clause and the reasoning for editing:\n\nEND_RESULT The clause has been revised to enhance clarity and readability.\n\nRevised clause:\n\"The involved party shall ensure that the Financing Sources provide the necessary funding for the Financing by the Closing deadline, utilizing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and/or Financing Agreements, if required.\"\n\nReasoning for editing:\n- The original phrase \"causing the Financing Sources to fund the Financing\" has been replaced with \"shall ensure that the Financing Sources provide the necessary funding for the Financing,\" which provides a more direct and clear statement of the responsibility.\n- The mention of \"enforcing its rights under the Debt Commitment Letters and/or Financing Agreements\" has been added to specify the potential actions the involved party can take to fulfill their responsibility in case it becomes necessary.\n\n"
