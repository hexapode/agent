    "answer": "To check if the clause is well written, I will analyze the structure and content of the clause.\n\n1. Examine the clarity and concise expression of the clause.\n2. Determine if there are any grammatical errors or awkward phrasing.\n3. Assess the coherence and logical flow of the clause.\n4. Check if the clause adheres to the desired legal terminology and format.\n5. Verify if the meaning of \"D&O Indemnified Parties\" is appropriately defined in Section 6.6(a).\n\nBased on the provided clause, it seems incomplete and lacks proper phrasing. To create a well-written version, I recommend the following revision:\n\nEND_RESULT \"Well-written :)\"\n\n\"A six-year indemnification period is specified for directors and officers (referred to as 'D&O Indemnified Parties' as defined in Section 6.6(a)).\"\n\nThis revision clarifies the duration of the indemnification period and includes proper references."
