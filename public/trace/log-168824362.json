The total may be 193, 195, 197, or even 199.\n<i>4.6K</i>\nHow many countries are there in the world? According to the United Nations member list, there may be as few as 193 countries or as many as 197, but the real answer is a bit more complicated than that.\n\nWhat about places like Kosovo and Taiwan? Are they countries? Even though they’re unrecognized by the UN and may be politically controversial, they meet all of the criteria to be considered sovereign states.\n\nIn this article, I’ll explain some of these issues and why it’s hard to come to an exact tally of the world’s countries. Then I’ll give my opinion on why I think the real total is at least 199 countries, and probably even more.\n\nThis topic interests me because I’m on a journey myself to someday visit every country in the world, as you can see on my <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//')\">travel blog</a>. But before I can do that, I first have to figure out how many countries there are!

(Definition)</b></b>\nThe Oxford dictionary defines a country as “a nation with its own government, occupying a particular territory.” The <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/country')\">Britannica dictionary</a> gives a similar definition.\n\nMeanwhile, the <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/country')\">Cambridge dictionary</a> defines a country as “an area of land that has its own government, army, etc.”\n\nWe’ll come back to these definitions later, because they may be helpful for understanding how to classify disputed countries.\n\n<b><b>How Many Countries In The World? (UN Definition)</b></b>\nSo how many countries are there in the world? The best place to start is the United Nations member list. It’s not perfect, but it’s quite comprehensive and includes most of the countries of the world.\n\nWhen we look at the United Nations list, here is what we see:\n\n<ul><li>193 UN member states</li><li>2 UN General Assembly non-member observer states (Palestine, Holy See)</li><li>2 eligible non-member states (Cook Islands, Niue)</li></ul>\nIf you add all of these up, you get a total of 193, 195, or 197 countries. Under the strictest definition (UN membership) there would be 193 countries, or under the loosest definition (all eligible states) there would be 197.\n\nI don’t think it’s fair to exclude a country from the total just because it’s not a UN member, as long as it’s eligible for membership and meets all the criteria for being considered a country, so it’s only logical to say that there are a total of 197 countries.\n\nSo there you have it — 197 countries! We’re done, right? <b>Wrong</b>. There’s still the issue of Kosovo and Taiwan, which are unrecognized by the UN. So how do we classify them?\n\n<a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//destinations/taiwan-travel-guide/')\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/></a><a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//destinations/taiwan-travel-guide/')\">Taiwan</a> isn’t recognized by the UN, but it fits any definition of a sovereign country.\n\n \n<b><b>Is Taiwan A Country? Yes</b></b>\nIn 1949, Communist forces took control of mainland China in a civil war, forcing out the leaders of the Republic of China and its followers, who fled to the island of Formosa (Taiwan).\n\nSince then, <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//destinations/taiwan-travel-guide/')\">Taiwan</a> has been an independently governed country with its own flag, currency, military, constitution, widely accepted passport, and an independently elected president.\n\nTaiwan was one of the original founding members of the United Nations, and it was still recognized as the sole legitimate representative of China by a majority of UN members until the 1970s, when mainland China’s influence began to grow rapidly and Taiwan was voted out of the UN in their favor.\n\nToday, China tries to claim ownership over Taiwan, and it gets touchy when anyone calls Taiwan a country. Basically, the rest of the world wants to preserve their relationship with mainland China, which is now an economic power, so they’re hesitant to recognize Taiwan.\n\nTaiwan is officially recognized by 13 UN member states, and it maintains unofficial relations with around 100 nations, including the United States and Japan. The <b>only</b> reason it’s not officially considered a country by the UN is because of politics.\n\nSo in conclusion, yes, Taiwan is a country! It meets and exceeds the criteria in every way.\n\n<a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//destinations/taiwan-travel-guide/')\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/></a>We had a lot of fun traveling in <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//destinations/taiwan-travel-guide/')\">Taiwan</a>\n\n \n<b><b>Is Kosovo A Country? Yes</b></b>\nKosovo split off from the European country of Serbia in 2008, and it’s acted as an independent country since then. They have their own flag, passport, armed forces, and constitution.\n\nEven though Kosovo has diplomatic recognition as a sovereign state by 101 member states of the United Nations, it hasn’t been allowed membership in the UN and the European Union because Serbia continues to claim Kosovo as its own, with Serbia’s ally Russia backing it up.\n\nBasically, politics is the only reason anyone would deny that Kosovo is a country. Nevertheless, Kosovo <b>is</b> an independent country in every sense of the word, so it’s only logical to include it in the total number.\n\n<b><b>Full List Of Countries In The World</b></b>\nHere is an alphabetical list of all the countries in the world, according to the United Nations. This is the official <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('https://www.un.org/en/about-us/member-states')\">UN member list</a> from their website.\n\nPlus, at the end, I’ll list a handful of disputed or miscellaneous countries that also meet the criteria to be included:\n\n<ul><li><b>1.

My inner OCD wants it to be an even 200, but at the moment that’s not the case!\n\n<b><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></b>\n\n\n<b><b>• What Is The World’s Newest Country?</b></b>\nThe newest (or youngest) country in the world is currently South Sudan in Africa, which split from Sudan in 2011. It has almost 13 million people, and its capital and largest city is Juba.\n\nBefore that, the world’s newest UN-recognized country was Montenegro in Europe, which separated from Serbia in 2006.\n\n<b><b>• What Is The World’s Oldest Country?</b></b>\nIt’s hard to pinpoint the world’s oldest country, but some contenders are China, Egypt, India, Iran, and Japan.\n\n<a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//the-great-pyramids-of-giza-in-egypt-facts-tours-pictures/')\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20900%20600'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/></a>The <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//the-great-pyramids-of-giza-in-egypt-facts-tours-pictures/')\">Egypt pyramids</a> were built in 2560 BC. Now that’s old!\n\n \n<b><b>• What Is The World’s Biggest Country?</b></b>\nThe world’s biggest country is Russia by far, with a total area of 17,098,242 square kilometers (6,601,665 mi²). Russia spans 11 time zones across two <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//how-many-continents-are-there/')\">continents</a> (Asia and Europe) and covers one-tenth of all the land on Earth.\n\nThe second and third biggest countries in the world are Canada and the United States, respectively. The UK could fit into Canada more than 40 times! There’s a lot of wonderful nature in both of these countries, with diverse landscapes and lots of freedom to roam.\n\n<b>Read More: <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//largest-countries-in-the-world/')\">Largest Countries In The World</a></b>\n\n<a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//largest-countries-in-the-world/')\"><img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20667'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/></a>The United States is the <a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com//largest-countries-in-the-world/')\">3rd biggest country</a> in the world.\n\n \n<b><b>• What Is The World’s Smallest Country?</b></b>\nThe world’s smallest country in area and population is the Holy See — the Vatican City has a population of 800 people and an area of 44 hectares (109 acres).\n\nIf you go by UN membership strictly, the world’s smallest country in terms of area is Monaco, which covers 202 hectares (499 acres). It has a population of about 40,000 people, making it the most densely populated country in the world.\n\nAnother interesting country is Nauru, which is a remote little island of 21 square kilometers (8 mi²). It’s the world’s least populous country among UN membership states, and the 2nd smallest UN country by area.\n\n<b><b>• What Is The Most Populous Country?</b></b>\nChina is currently the world’s most populous country, with 1.44 billion people. However, India is expected to surpass this number soon, putting it ahead of China.\n\n<b><b>• What Is My Favorite Country?</b></b>\nA lot of people ask me about my favorite places to travel.

Ít is West Sahara. Morocco claims to have is a part of the country, but very few countries in the world have recognized this soverighty. So, as Palestine, where the people have been fighting for a nation for half a century, West Sahara deserves to be on the list. In quite a few maps you will actually see the borderline drawn.\n<a class=\"link\" onclick=\"Navigate('theworldtravelguy.com/#comment-1207')\">Reply</a>\n<img src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/>\nDavid\nJanuary 21, 2023 - 2:57 am\nThanks for your comment! You’re right, Western Sahara is a peculiar case. On world maps it’s common to see the borders drawn for Western Sahara, and I have a globe at home with that border drawn. Western Sahara is also recognized by 45 UN member states (at one time it was 84 UN member states but many of those have since withdrawn recognition).\n\n\n\nI’m still not sure if it would qualify as an independent country though, since Western Sahara is mostly governed by Morocco. Even the biggest city Laayoune is administered by Morocco. The SADR group has their own currency and a passport accepted by countries that recognize SADR, but they mainly use Moroccan currency.\n\n\n\nThe UN officially classifies Western Sahara as a non-self-governing territory because it’s mainly administered by the Moroccan government. Normal definitions of a country mean one that is independently governed, so Western Sahara seems like it would fail that test. It’s hard to say, but in any case, I’ll add a note about it to the article!

Love traveling too. I am from Sarawak, Malaysia. I’ve been to Jakarta, Jogja, Bandung, and Bali a couple of times. Also, been to the Philippines a number of times, Cambodia, Thailand, Perth Australia, London (love to explore more places in the UK in the future), Germany, Austria, Italy, France, Switzerland.
