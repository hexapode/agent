For example, an exclusion clause in a life insurance contract may state that <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/does-a-life-insurance-policy-cover-suicide-2645609\">a death by suicide is excluded</a>.\n\nGenerally, only the parties to the contract can rely on the exclusion clause, absent clear evidence that non-parties are intended to be protected too.

Generally, by including an arbitration clause in a contract, the parties agree <a href=\"https://www.adr.org/Clauses\">to first attempt to resolve any disputes through arbitration</a> rather than litigation.\n\nArbitration is a process that allows a neutral third-party arbitrator to work with the parties to resolve their disputes. It is much less formal than a court proceeding. If the parties do not come to a mutual agreement during the arbitration, the arbitrator will issue a ruling on the dispute.\n\nIf the arbitration clause specifies that <a href=\"https://www.arbitration.com/articles/canapartystillsueafterbindingarbitration.aspx\">the arbitration will be binding</a>, it means that both parties must abide by the ruling and it cannot be appealed in court. A party to a non-binding arbitration may take the matter to court if it is not satisfied with the arbitration ruling.\n\n                            \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n\n                            What is a force majeure clause?\n                                    <img />\n                                \n                                A force majeure clause is a provision in a contract that exempts the parties from liability if they are prevented from performing their contractual obligations by unforeseeable circumstances beyond their control. The term force majeure is French for “superior force.”\n\nEvents such as “acts of God” that prevent contract performance are usually considered force majeure. <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/force_majeure\">Examples include</a> a major earthquake or severe flooding. There are also cases of human-caused force majeure, such as an act of terrorism or war.\n\n                            \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n\n                            What is an escalation clause?\n                                    <img />\n                                \n                                An escalation clause is a provision in a contract that allows for one party to increase the contracted-for prices or wages under certain specified conditions. This clause is often found in labor contracts, which may include escalation clauses that tie such increases to the rate of inflation. Many different types of contracts contain multiple escalation clauses addressing different subjects, allowing the parties to accommodate shifts and changes in the market.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.levelset.com/blog/construction-contracts-how-an-escalation-clause-can-help-the-bottom-line/\">In construction contracts</a>, an escalation clause may provide for increases in the contracted price for labor or materials based on a change in market price or the increase of an index, such as the consumer price index. In leases, this clause may allow for lease costs to rise if maintenance and operation expenses rise. <a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/what-is-an-escalation-clause-how-does-it-work-and-when-should-you-use-one/\">In real estate sales</a>, an escalation clause may provide for an increase the purchase price if higher bona fide offers are made on the property by third parties.

When a cancellation clause is included in a contract, it specifies the terms or conditions that must be met in order for a party to end the contract under the cancellation clause. Generally, a party seeking to terminate the contract based on the cancellation clause must provide the other party with written notice.\n\n                            \n\n                        \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n                            \n\n                            \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                            \n\n                            What is a penalty clause?\n                                    <img />\n                                \n                                A penalty clause in a contract is a provision that requires a party that has not fulfilled its contractual obligations to pay specified compensation to the other party for the breach. Unlike a liquidated damages clause, a penalty clause is not tied to an estimate of possible actual damages.
